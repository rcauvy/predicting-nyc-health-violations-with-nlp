    "According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 48 million Americans per year become sick from food, and an estimated 75% of the outbreaks came from food prepared by caterers, delis, and restaurants. In most cities, health inspections are generally random, which can increase time spent on spot checks at clean restaurants that have been following the rules closely — and missed opportunities to improve health and hygiene at places with more pressing food safety issues.\n",

    "The goal for this project is to leverage public citizen generated data from social media to narrow the search for critical health and safety violations in New York City. As the City of New York manages  an open data portal, everyone can access historical hygiene inspections and violation records. By combine these two data source this project aims to determine which words, phrases, ratings, and patterns among restaurants lead to critical health and safety violations. This model can assist city health inspectors do their job better by prioritizing the kitchens most likely to be in violation of code."
