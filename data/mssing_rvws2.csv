"This is your classic neighborhood spot for bagels, pastries, and coffee. There is a lot of room for seating, but it's just as easy to grab and go. The counter service was fast and there were lots of bagels and treats to choose from. Great option for something quick..Stopped by for a bagel in the morning and asked if they had tofu cream cheese since I was lactose intolerant. The young guy at the counter loudly replied ""we don't carry that. I don't want b***h  ti*s"" then continued on a tirade on how soy gives men  boobs. Sorry my guy, you are an idiot and if that was true, no one would be getting breast implants, they would just eat soy.  How about you just STFU and do your job, say no we don't have that and keep moving on..I'm a student at SJU so Bagels N Cream is within easy walking distance of campus, and it is definitely one of my top 3 favorite bagel shops in NYC. Their bagels are fresh, huge and super doughy, which I love. They also make amazing cookies/pastries!.I came to get my Smoked fish craving addressed. There are not a lot of places that have smoked Sable. It's my favorite on a sesame bagel with butter. That's what I got and it was yummy! The staff was very nice and they were following protocol wearing gloves. The place is spacious and they have booths that are spaced out fir people to sit comfortably..Was in the area for an early appointment, and decided to pop in for breakfast. I was tempted by the pastries and muffins, but opted for a toasted sesame bagel with low-fat cream cheese. I added a 16oz coffee to my order and headed to the register. Somehow my total was $6.50, which felt a bit high. My food was quickly served on a tray and I took a seat at a booth on the side to eat. I bit into my bagel and was underwhelmed. The cream cheese tasted a bit...funky. The bagel was average. I took half to go because I wasn't feelin it. The worst part was the coffee. It was just awful, super watery, the weakest coffee I have had in a loooong time.This spot was quick and convenient for today, but I wouldnt go out of my way to return..Come early to get your bagels. Was here at 2:20 pm and there were not many bagels left. Staff mentioned by 12 pm most bagel are gone.Luckily got my 2 favorites- Cranberry and Raisin Bagel and Pumpernickel. Bagels are huge and crusty on the  outside. Inside soft and chewy. I just get the bagels to go and their Rugelach (4 pieces in container).Bagels are $1.10Rugelach $3.00Have been here numerous times. The coffee not my cup of tea.Not into the cream cheese here.Just the bagels!!!.The most disgusting place I have ever been to. Had an appt. with my local acct. and after the ordeal said lets have a bagel (How bad could it be?) I ordered a Plain Bagel with lox cc spread and my with an everything bagel with cc. Well I have never had mold on my loX cream cheese ???? I should call the dept. of health . I spoke to the rude girl at the counter and she basically dismissed me like how do we know it was from here! I immediately asked to speak with the owner who said his name was nick and he began to belittle us in the store !!! And was the rudest person I have ever dealt with , he would not give me a refund or a new bagel which I didnt want to eat more MOLD !!!!!!   You will be going out of business soon !!  A small community place mostly close knit and you serve molded cc. NEVER again Nicky..I went in today for 2 bagels. I've lived in the neighborhood many years and have come here often. I won't be going back and recommend you stay away if you value the health protocols currently in place. This was my experience today:It was the rude guy everyone references. Normally I don't mind interacting with him or the brusque manner. It really doesn't bother me. However while making my bagel he took care of several tasks in the back bringing buckets and containers, etc to the front. I asked him to put on gloves and he only put on one. Saying that's all that's required. He comes around to the register and starts with are you afraid to die? Because this is what I need today, with my bagel. I'm not afraid to die, but that day was not the day. Sir,  do I want to die by bagel? I'm not saying don't go here, only wait until there's no pandemic involved. Stay away from any insanity..VERY VERY VERY RUDE people working there!!!! They take pleasure in embarrassing you in front of other customers!!!!  They need to learn how to talk to people!!!! And the tables are dirty. There are many other bagels stores on Union Turnpike!!!!! That is where I will be taking by business!!!!.This place may be the most filthy location I have ever been to in my entire life. The displays look like they have not been cleaned in months. Everything seems to have a layer of grime on it. If you worry cleanliness I recommend avoiding this place."
"We've eaten pizzas coast to coast, but this place in Brooklyn is the one we like the most. Apologies for the random rhyme, I couldn't resist. A week ago, I order half plain and half mushroom. It's possible that we had let this pie sit for a while before we chowed down so the slices were a bit dry and not as appetizing as I had hoped for. I decided to give it another shot and order a couple of pies two days ago, and we genuinely were surprised that it hits all the right marks: good cheese to sauce ratio, adequate amount of chew, the proper level of crispiness, and the perfect crust size. Docking off one star only because their menu is stripped of their prices so you're really unclear how much everything is until you either asked them or have the cashier ring you up. Also, I do suspect they charge tax because my 2 pies and 2 orders of garlic knots came out to be $47.90 or something like that; but definitely $47 and some change, which I happily paid for plus stuffed extra in the tipping box. It's just a tad perplexing because I've never paid tax for pizza before, which isn't a big deal but I'm sure people would like to know there is tax for their slices..Classic slice in a classic location, I can't say it's worth coming out of your way for but it's a solid choice if you're nearby. Properly thin and crispy crust, root beer, and that old school pizzeria vibe. They also made my poor vegan friend a cheese-less personal pizza, which j thought was really sweet..It's a really great mom and pop shop that's been around for a long time. The lasagna slices are amazing!!.Lennys burned me so bad. Got charged out the wazoo for tiny fried raviolis. Bring back your old fried raviolis what the fuck.Some of the greatest pizza i ever had. The grandma slice is consistent and perfect every time. Lennys is by far one of the greatest pizzerias i have ever been to. I order from them almost once a week.Legendary pizza place for a reason. And not just because it's where John Travolta got his pizza in Saturday Night Fever.  The quintessential Brooklyn slice. Delicious. And outrageously large garlic knots..I will get this out of the way quickly, yes, this is the pizzeria that John Travolta (aka Tony Manero) buys two slices at, then struts down 86th street like a boss in the opening sequence of the film, ""Saturday Night Fever"".It is unfortunate I could not replicate this sequence, as it was hard to juggle my phone and the two slices to try and photograph the moment, and in Covid climate, I would look pretty stupid. So I ate the slices on a nearby bench. Lame. What is cool is that the D train runs alongside you as you walk down the street with your new purchases. That feels pretty special.As for the pizza, you get what you pay for. Two slices for roughly $6 gets you exactly that, a cheap tasting pizza. Solidly simple slices, nothing about them will blow you away. Bland in the sauce and cheese, crispy crust, little bit chew, but no wow factor to the overall flavor. In short, this is definitely not the best slice in the city. Not by a long shot.Even though Lenny's was made famous in a movie, it does not necessarily mean the pizza is good. If you want to stop here just to say you went here for the reason I just stated, go ahead. It is a small attraction, but it also acts like a local pizzeria. Nothing more or less. You get your slices and strut down the street glancing at people as you chomp down. That pretty much sums it up..Always good service food is consistent and delicious.  I have been ordering from them since I moved to Brookkyn in 1976.  The establishment is clean and the people are pleasant always.Great food,clean service is great.  I have been coming here since 1976.  If you order out delivery is fast and correct..Great local pizza spot! We ordered a pie for pick up and it was ready quickly and made hot and fresh! Have yet to try anything else but the pizza but it's definitely a place I will be trying more of!.This is my first time ordering here, I ordered a Philly cheese steak and cheese fries. The sandwich is pretty good especially in Brooklyn. The bread is nice and crunchy and soft inside. I highly recommend eating here if u want a Philly cheese steak."
"Great local/lowkey spot to hang out and grab some drinks and some good appetizers.. plus the dart board is free to use.i dont booze but i do eat pub grub and down  many diet cokes and doyles  corner in astoria is a great place for both . sit at the bar or one of the many tables where you can enjoy full bar drinks or munch on traditional irish cuisine or typical american food like burgers,  wings. tenders , pork chops , mac &cheese , etc. while my cuz is sitting at the left end of the bar drinking and sweet talking some random lady , i am on the right end of the bar watching college basketball on the many large screens and enjoying my chicken sandwich with fries no salt . the staff are nice folks and my glass of diet coke was never empty for long . overall a nice friendly irish pub to eat, drink , watch sports and hang with friends or with a cuz who thinks he is gods gift to the female world..Racist...After skimming through some reviews, it is evident to see what the one star ones are about.. let me elaborate:Arrived with my boyfriend for a quick drink and we were turned away because ""we didn't have our vaccination card."" We are vaccinated. I suggested to my bf to present our vaccination cards in a photo he has in his phone, and unfortunately (whoever the bartender/or owner?) was, did not budge. He actually suggested for us to sit outside. In the pouring rain. His condescending demeanor seemed like he didn't want to serve us, and it made us feel uncomfortable -so we left.We realized that there were no POC upon leaving, (we are Latinos by the way). We came to terms that we were discriminated, -not a good feeling. Personally, I'm not a bad reviews kind of gal unless the experience was really bad. If it was meh, wouldn't even bother. But this one here took the cake. It's really messed up because we are locals. But I digress, we will not go back..Great neighborhood pub. Staff is awesome (especially the bartender Paul), drink prices are fair and the food is stellar..Doyle's Corner is your classic NYC pub. Great food, drinks, and local color delivered by owner Martin and the welcoming staff. It's old school perfection that anyone with a soul will appreciate! If you live in the neighborhood, walk over. If you don't, it's worth a quick trip on the R train to get here. This is how we do it in Astoria!  I'll see you at Doyle's Corner!.This place is really nice my experience last night A guy name is Connor he's a owner I'm not sure but he's very nasty rude and respectful and a racist if you are asian i'm a regular customer and a Guinness draft beer lover sometimes the Guinness is super flat sometimes it's good but I don't mind and why is only cash the encouraging customer to pay ??????.This is definitely your neighborhood Irish pub. I had Bacon Corn Chowder and Grilled Pork Chops. Both tasted amazing -- surprisingly. Bartender was really friendly. Beer choices are quite limited here -- just the standards on tap. Smithwick's was fresh and cold, so I was happy still..STORYYYYYY TIME! So Yato was in here, looking cool, downing screwdrivers at the suggestion of his date. Look, Yato really enjoyed those screwdrivers. Amazing. Then came the Irish Carbombs suggested by the bartender. Holy flying f**k did they hit after 3 of them. But you know what? Yato had a pretty good time. Played Train on the juke box and people sung along like they were in San Francisco. Prices were pretty fair, food was pretty good. Crowd was pretty chilled and staff kept it that way. This is how you run a bar. Everyone has a good time and everyone feels good. Everyone is looking after one another and the place stays chilled. No excuses. You want a good time, come in. But remember, keep yourself in check and you'll love it! PRO TIP! Bartenders are actually good at suggestions here! The fried ravioli hit the spot too!.Cute little local bar in Astoria. Shockingly the food is pretty good! The staff is always very sweet. Check it out!.Been here a few times with family and friends. Brandon, Paul and Vladimir make this a great place to visit.The food specials are phenomenal as recommended by Vladimir. In particular, the grilled calamari salad. Shrimp was very good as well as the chicken tenders. The burger is tasty and fries are light and crispy. My last visit was marred by codfish that had a very strong odor. Surprised the chef and waitress served it. Appreciate if an alternative is recommended instead."
"First time at a Brooklyn NY diner and I was not disappointed especially being from the the state of NJ known for its diners. I wanted fish and chip but my choice was not on the menu. Waitress suggested a fish sandwich but without the bread. My order arrived to perfection- well done fries and fish was prepared crispy..Do t you live a good diner?  You can eat breakfast at any time! Of the day- what a genius idea!   Well this is a Terrific diner- good food - excellent customer service - I don't live in the area, but when I am passing  through I stop here.  What do I have?  usually breakfast....but you knew that.....Arch Diner has always been a place you go to for last minute breakfast, lunches or even after party munches. The service isn't always the best but there are a few who make the experience easy going and don't forget you're a customer. Today I went with my dad for an impromptu breakfast. It's in our neighborhood and we stopped in. There weren't too many people and enough for the tables to be spaced out for social distancing so that was a plus. We ordered with the waiter who seemed very rushed for an empty place. While I admit I wasn't expecting it, our food literally came out maybe 10 mins or less than that, later. It was speedy but it makes you wonder if it was made to order lol. Diner food is always great because its suppose to be fresh and made to order. Today it wasn't fresh.... the potato hash or ""home fries"" was definitely out of a bag.  You can tell it was stale and tasted artificial. Even the few onions and peppers tossed in there you can tell was either frozen or apart of the prepared home fries. Table salt and pepper couldn't do much for that. I feel like it wasn't always like this or this place wouldn't be as clutch for me, something probably made the decision to change. I'd say change it right back..My first time ordering from here and beyond happy. My curly fries with cheese and gravy was mouth watering and my Gyro wrap was petfrction !!!! Deliciousssss.Service was on point. Our server was very patient with us and respectful and very attentive. The food is not that great and they fries are really big. The ranch sauce doesn't taste like ranch. I had order the hot wings with fries and ranch sauce. Didn't enjoy my meal. But service was outstanding. Food not good. Atmosphere very clean and welcoming.Came here with a party of 3 for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was not overly crowded, we managed to get a booth! We ordered the omelette breakfast special that was $12.60 each which comes with the omelette, home fries, toast, your choice of juice, and coffee/tea. The omelette was a bit on the plain side but that could be fixed with the salt and pepper bottles on the table. Home fries were good, and we were very hydrated since we each had the holy trinity of drinks (juice, coffee, and nice cold water). The vibe is chill, great place to come for basic breakfast. I don't why but I expected to see a jukebox; there was no music playing but that's good for customers to easily hear each other. The service was great and a gratuity of 15% was added to the total. Come by if you're looking for a filling and cheap breakfast and get the mushroom and onion omelette!.The arch, the epicenter of my early adult years, my drunken college nights would conclude here. Lets start shall we? Its a DIVE, a hole in the wall, located in a pretty shabby part of brooklyn, but if you want a quick, CHEAP meal this is the spot. They are known for their disco fries and their overly greasy burgers which is awesome to soak up alcohol. Its dirty inside, crazy people come through, but its what keeps it entertaining. The arch has seen its share of times man, but it remains consistent for a decent meal at a decent price..The price is steep for a diner. The food and service is always good. The waitress was cleaning up but she's nice. The gratuity is added to the check. There's a sign on the door that ""bathrooms are for customers only."" If you're not a customer and want to use the bathroom, it is a $1.00charge for water use.The decor haven't changed much throughout the years..I been coming to this diner, for  about 20 years and  it's cool it's "" diner food ""  over the last few years they incorporated  certain things  into the menu like a "" West Indian breakfast  "" it's great ! I dine here often  enough with my cousin  The cappuccinos  are great !!!! Only issue i had was they made aa mistake,   instead of  putting sugar in my cup they put salt tHeY quickly corrected it when i Made them aware  .. the staff are really nice   ( waiters & waitress only) ... i would done here for  good "" diner food "" GOT MY VOTE.Ordered a simple Turkey burger.  Was a mixed up and when this woman took it to the back to fix it,  when it came back out it tasted and smelled  Suspicious  after the first bite. I started feeling bad spit out the first bite out and I got my money refunded just hope  I don't catch nothing. Feeling sick. Never going back.#neversendfoodback"
"My husband and I came across this pub as we visited NYC from LA. We almost didn't walk in but there sign outside caught our eye. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place if you want a super cold beer, great service (bartender Kate super sweet and friendly), amazing fries. Make sure you ask for the ranch it was so good lol. (I'm picky with my ranch)..Service 2/5 -- Service was horrible. It took a while just to get a can of beer and the check on a calm night. Food 0/5 -- If Gordan Ramsey was here, he'd probably curse out. Frozen food, deep fried and unflavored. I never thought a place could fail frying food. I thought it was funny when our server was preening herself up in front of the mirror that was along the wall next to our table as we were giving her our orders. As though her customer's suddenly disappeared when she looked herself in the mirror lol.Visiting the city found this IRISH PUB near by my hotel. Decided to give it a shot and worth it. We all know the hard times we are living on nowadays and a smile can make someone's else day. The waiter who attended me carries a such good energy that could warm the whole ambient. They are probably reduced staff but she was handling tabs on time and happily. Also, following restriction rules as you can see in the pictures. Regarding food, ordered a Hummus & Grilled Pita.  Everything was so good and fresh and didn't take a blink to sit on my table. Hummus well seasoned and perfect texture. Pita bread was so good that a good eat loads of them. Warm, soft but slightly crispy outside - a perfect marriage - where the best man can be also named Celery, to complete the big picture. Simple but honest food.To give some extra flavor to my meal, a Guiness and cheers :-).Came here for lunch with coworkers a few weeks ago. Our server was great. She took our drink orders right away and then came back to take our food order after we had a minute to look over the menu. Look, the menu is very simple and to the point, however! The food is good. I ordered the Cajun fries with wings and thought they both were tasty. I wish the fries had a bit more of a crunch to them, but it still doesn't take away from how tasty they were..Stopped into The Irish Punt on Saturday evening for a quick drink and some snacks. With so many other good places in the area, there is no need to spend any time here.Quality: The food was embarrassing. I ordered Mozzarella Sticks and the Soft Pretzel with Cheese. They essentially served me frozen food from the supermarket. Except they also failed to cook it for the right amount of time, so pieces were soggy and cold. Looking at the pretzel I was left wondering how they could even think serving this is acceptable. The beer selection was also terrible and my beer came out warm.Quantity: Small portions, but with the quality still more than you need. Value: $9 for the Mozzarella Sticks. $8 for the Soft Pretzel with Cheese. $8 for the Draft Beer I ordered.Ambiance: The Irish Punt is right near the Stock Exchange in Manhattan. On a side road near several apartment building entrances, the pub sticks out. Inside it has the standard look of an Irish pub, with the long bar and several televisions as the main focus. The unique element is a ton of ties that hang from the wall. The music selection was horrendous, with teen pop hits blaring during my entire visit.Crowd: It was busy, but not crowded. I couldn't understand why with other better options nearby.Service: The girl behind the bar was very friendly. One of the only good things I can say about the place.Parking: Terrible area for trying to find a parking spot..Today was my second visit and I will attach pictures and list the pro's and con's:Pro's: Sheppard's pie was piping hot and flavorful (although the beef should have been chunkier)Turkey burger and fries were standardService: very friendly and welcomingLooked over to other tables to see what others were eating and everything appeared freshCon's:Way overpriced, no lunch time drink special nor do they have reasonable happy hour pricesBoth visits we had Moscow Mules and they were weak.  For $10 a drink it would be ideal if they had an extra kick!$16 for my Sheppard's pie at lunch time seems ridiculous but clearly those are typical Financial District pricesI had to ask for water (All restaurants should automatically give you water and extra napkins)Décor a bit dingy, gloomy and mustyUnfortunately, although it is conveniently close to my job, I highly doubt I will bother going there again..Service with a smile. Real Irish brogue style pub that serves all the necessaries. Stop by for lunch and the Punt Salad. Have a ""half and half"" while your at it..Great neighborhood bar.  Terrific lunch menu have had many meetings there.  Great service by attentive staff..Where has the Punt been all my life!? I've only been in the city a little over a year and am always on the hunt for a good neighborhood bar and this is definitely a great one! This isn't your typical, large Irish, beer-haul-esque place, this is a cozy little spot nestled in Fidi with friendly staff and a crowd of regulars who clearly love being there (and have been coming for years). Though I wasn't fortunate enough to have been able to experience the Punt pre-Covid (because it sounds epic), I still enjoyed my time there hanging out and meeting the people who give the place its fun personality. Though they don't have outdoor seating, they took the proper precautions when I arrived (taking my temperature, having me sign in etc.) so I felt totally safe. I will definitely be coming back again and bringing more friends! Just beware of the skittle bombs :D.Amazing pot pies, meatloaf is to die for..  management and waitresses are fun and friendly.      Try the Morrocan Turkey Burger.. say Hi to Devon and Dierdra!      FUN TIME GUARANTEED!!!!!.The burger was Eh The fries were Eh Eh The customer service was not good at all. Not impressed at all."
"I'm a tough critic when it comes with middle eastern food since I grew up there. This place is a little hidden, super cute and authentic. The food is alright. I mean, lacks flavor. The tabouli was 80% bulgur which shouldn't be the case. Ouzi lacked flavor as well. My favorite thing was the grape leaves. Absolutely amazing!! They saved the review..I came yesterday for dinner with 4 friends. We ordered 5 dishes to share. I really liked the babaganoush and another dish that had curry. The rest were average. There was a dish that had grilled shrimps that tasted amazing but the lamb sausage was was too strong for me. The service was slow but really friendly and patient which is great for covid times. We had a couple of beautiful Moroccan tables on the side walk. The street has a lot of cars and ambulances passing by but not a lot of people walking so that's good. In terms of drinks, we all agreed that none of the alcoholic drinks that had mint really tasted minty. My mango mojito didn't taste like a mojito at all. It was like mango juice with rum and a few mint leaves. So I would improve the drinks. We shared baklava for dessert which was delicious but a bit oily. We ended up spending around $30 per person which I think is pretty good for NYC. It was a nice experience..My Favorite spot in the west village. The food is delicious and reasonably priced (for the city). The chef Bassam and Joan are such a delight and very welcoming. Syrian inspired food and western fusion. Highly recommend!.I've been here a few times and it's always been great! I got the lamb with couscous and vegetables and it was delicious! My table also for the grilled chicken kebab with two sides (he got hummus and babaganoush) and  vegetable curry. They're doing social distancing really well with spaced out tables, hand sanitizer, and the waitress wore gloves and a mask. I'll be back soon!.This is such a cozy restaurant! I'm often in the city for work and typically dine out solo, but despite being alone, the very nice waitress offered me a beautiful booth right by the window. I enjoyed a glass of cabernet, and a salad with tomatoes and cucumber as my starter. I was shocked to see the size of the salad, it was much bigger than your average app. It went very well main entree, which was chicken kebab and hummus and baba ganoush on the side. Pita is complimentary and good, but slightly over toasted. I really enjoyed my meal and the service was wonderful. I'll be back!.I never write yelp reviews and felt compelled to because how impressed I was by this restaurant. The quality of their food is impeccable. It is by far the best middle eastern food I've had in the city!  It is not a sceney restaurant. It's a place to come to relax and eat an incredible meal.  Thanks for never letting us down, Salam.I ate at salam 2 nights in a row because the food is THAT good.  The lamb in yogurt sauce and shrimp yellow curry are me and my husbands favorite.  It is truly a rare neighborhood GEM!   You will not regret coming here..I never write yelp reviews and felt compelled to because how impressed I was by this restaurant. The quality of their food is impeccable. It is by far the best middle eastern food I've had in the city!  It is not a sceney restaurant. It's a place to come to relax and eat an incredible meal.  Thanks for never letting us down, Salam!!.I miss coming to this restaurant, & I look forward to this pandemic ending so I can dine there again.  I went a few times with a group & we shared appetizers & ordered other plates to share as well w/ wine & baklava afterwards.  Everyone loved the food & it was all served so fresh w/ warm bread. I am crazy about their vegetable tomato sauce/coriander dish.  It was so perfectly flavored.  The decor is fun and cozy..Not much to say, just speechless about the rude service, I just feel like I wasn't there, throw the food on the table and disappeared!! So far the worst I had in general in NYC!.Is this place still open? We went for lunch today and it was closed and there seemed to be one of those realtor locks on the door..Food was very good, great local place.  Reasonably priced and wait staff attentive, menu had a decent selection."
"What a great place! Bob Marley and other stars on the wall. Amazingly friendly service. Come on down!.After waiting about 10 mins To have my order taken. Which is fine because I understand that a lot of places are still short staffed . However, the server seemed to be a bit unfamiliar with the menu. When The breakfast arrived both of our orders were incorrect but we kept it. The breakfast was horrible. Seems like it was made hours before and microwaved. We went to the counter to pay and the woman who finally arrived after 5 mins seemed as if she didn't want to respond back hello after my brother said hello first. I will never eat here again, this was a bad choice for breakfast !.I personally didn't want to give them 2 stars cause their food is pretty good but getting delivery is a whole different story. Where do start....I order through Uber eats and wanted 2 eggs scrambled with cheese, grits, sausage and a coffee on the side. What I get is a missing coffee and missing sausage. This isn't the first time I get missing and wrong items. Personally just dine in since this is my last time ordering via delivery.Very frustrating.....Definitely go for the eggs benedict and home fries, hits the spot and I must say it's GOOD, I came twice in a week and if you want something on the sweeter side the belgium waffle speaks for its self I must say....Having read previous reviews, I understood that the diner is understaffed, the service mediocre and I would have to wait a very long time for my food. I was okay with that as long as the food was good. I am a big believer that good food is worth waiting for.My daughter and I went to the diner for lunch on a rainy afternoon around 12:40 pm.There were only five customers there besides us. I ordered beef stew and my daughter ordered a cheeseburger deluxe. We waited over an hour for our food. It took so long we joked they had to go to a farm and bring back a cow. My soup came first. I ordered Matzo ball soup and the waitress brought chicken noodle soup. When I pointed out the mistake, she apologized then offered to give it to my daughter on the house. My daughter didn't want it so she brought it back to the kitchen and we waited another 15 minutes. You can see from my photo that all the cook did was dump the Matzo ball into the chicken noodle soup because the chicken pieces and noodles were still there. Anyway, after another long wait, our meals came and they looked delicious. Well worth the wait.... NOTAs you can see from my video, the beef in the beef stew was inedible. I had to poke really hard with my fork just to pick it up. The inside of my daughter's bun was so over toasted it might as well be a pumpernickel bun.I don't mind a long wait but a long wait resulting in inedible food is just WRONG. I told my daughter if there was ever a conflict between eating at USA Diner again or starving to death, I would rather die hungry then eat a horrendous food as my last meal. I DESERVE BETTER AND YOU DO TOO..Prior to coming here, I heard different things about this diner & it didn't paint a pretty picture, so I've always been apprehensive about coming here, however, after hanging out til the A.M hours & being hungry & this being conveniently located....I said why not.So my friend & I arrive & we're seated & our waitress greets us & hands us menus. I had the steak & eggs with home fries & my friend had eggs with bacon. The food was ok. We definitely needed salt & pepper, but it was ok. Our waitress came around once I believe, but she was fine as well. What was weird in there is the atmosphere. There's two clubs/lounge right across the street, so after the club closes, there coming right across the street, as well people coming from other locations who probably live around the area. There were some interesting sites in there, but that has no bearing on the diner it self per say.Overall everything was ok. The things I've heard about this diner was based on the atmosphere & not so much the service or food & although the atmosphere was accurate, based on the diner alone it was ok..Just bought a Buffalo chicken salad 20$ first off the cook you have in the kitchen who made this terrible salad should be fired immediately! If you employee who doesn't know fresh lettuce from rotten lettuce you are going to kill someone! This salad was supposed to be Buffalo there is no Buffalo sauce on it the lettuce is rotten chopped to big no blue chees as described non menu total crap! U should be embarrassed to server this ! Look at this shit.I ordered a cantaloupe with cottage chesses.  I was served  a whole  half of cantaloupe with the rind on.  I was so upset.  I don't serve my family or  myself with the rind on. I cannot believe they served my cantaloupe  not sliced not quartered.  I had cottage cheese on the side.  The service is terribleI serve my family must better than that.  That is like asking a 5 year old child to serve me cantaloupe.   The glaze is off the dishes.  which is unsafe the chemicals from the pottery gets in your food and digest it..This was the worst experience I've had ever the my order wasn't even correct I ordered waffle fries and a cheeseburger my cheeseburger was missing the waffle fries was caked on with American cheese. And very overcooked. Then I ordered potato salad and it was rancid. Would highly recommend not going to.This restaurant deserves 0 stars!! They shouldn't even be allowed to take orders through Uber eats. My order was completely wrong with the food I ordered and what they gave.  The proper thing to do is call me to see if I would like a substitution but the chef decided to make a order that was completely wrong and included ingredients that I am highly allergic to. I will never again order from a place that doesn't try to accommodate properly and assumes a person can just eat whatever is served!.If I could give ZERO stars, I would. Ordered breakfast from there and it was absolutely horrible. Never again will I order from this diner. 1) Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich: Thick, dry and untoasted roll. I had to throw half of the roll away because it was too thick. The bacon tastes like it was deep fried in oil and my cheese looks like it was just thrown on the sandwich. No melt whatsoever. At least my eggs were cooked properly. But I can definitely find a better bacon egg and cheese sandwich at the corner store and for half the price of this ridiculously made sandwich. 2) Chicken Gyro:  Oh dear, where do I begin?? Okay let's start with the fact that that ""chicken"" isn't real chicken at all. It looks like those meat blocks that spin on a rotisserie and are sliced off as needed. Never have I ever had a chicken gyro that looked or tasted quite like this. It had a spongy, yet dry texture and tasted like cardboard. Not to mention, they were super frugal with the meat portion and threw a garden full of veggies on top. This needs to be removed off the menu ASAP (matter fact...throw the WHOLE menu away), because I am CERTAIN that I could get a chicken gyro at Crown that looks and tastes 10,000 times better than this. The bright side: At least my dog liked the faux chicken‍....I think  Check out my photos for a visual description!"

"Great views.  I was here for a family reunion, Im classy like that.  Wish i had seen the pool, I will never have the opportunity to visit a private New York club again..Wonderful club. A little far to the east right on the east river. We had my father in law's memorial service here and they did a beautiful job. We used the two salon rooms overlooking the east river. They have a piano and allowed us to bring our own pianist in. We also come to the Kentucky Derby party every May. They have a summer membership for young people. Beautiful deco style interiors and a pool. Open to members and their guests..Wonderful sanctuary in the hubbub of the city.  The bedrooms have everything you need in old style classiness.  Quiet bedrooms with a view over the river.  The gin and tonics in the evening are wonderful.  If you haven't walked enough all over the city there is a fitness facility, a lovely pool and tennis court to keep in shape.  The dining room is beautifully decorated in aqua colors and a theme of boats.  The food is wonderful, the service impeccable.  A wonderful gastronomic evening.The only pity is that they are not currently serving breakfast..Classy place, attentive staff, member's only. Gotta know someone to get in. Pool, Squash, Tennis, and now ice skating in the winter, not a bad place to spend a Saturday afternoon,.Been coming here for 40 years. Pool, tennis courts, squash courts, excellent food, great views."
"Hands down has the best beef patty and coco bread. Much better than the well known bakeries around (IMO) Not to mention the chicken soup. If you want chicken soup just get there early because they always run out by the afternoon. Don't forget to pick up a slice of red velvet cake on the way out (super moist and not too sweet). They also have a wide variety of Jamaican dishes, I normally get the ackee and saltfish, curry goat, curry chicken or oxtail..DONT GO !!! Me and my friend came to this establishment to try some curry chicken and the cashier was so rude when i asked her a question about the curry chicken. The staff are very unprofessional they kiss there teeth and roll their eyes. Do not waste your money and go here . Please dont!!.Seriously delicious West Indian food .. was recommended to come here and every thing I got was soo good . And really nice staff !Definitely going back !.Worst worst service with the oxtails. I asked politely  for oxtail gravy twice and the chief in the back left my rice dry like a desert. The rice and oxtail had no gravy. The chef purposely drained out all the liquid leaving me with no gravy at all. I wasted time , money and energy to come to this establishment and get treated this way. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!!.My favorite spot for chicken and veggie patties. Due to COVID, mask are required and only 4 in the store at a time..I've been coming to Jackie's for as long as I can remember. The best patty in the Bronx hands down! I don't eat patty unless it's from here..Food is very good compared to other West Indian restaurants.  Friendly service and very good food.  Parking is horrible so be prepared!!.I love Jackie's! I've grown up on Jackie's food it's always good and staff treat you like family.Best Jamaican food hands down!.Deep deeeeeeeep in the Bronx is a great Jamaican spot.They offer a nice selection of breads, sandwiches, patty's, and plates. I had the jerk chicken sandwich with coco bread and tried the chicken and beef patty's.The coco bread was so fresh and soft. Just melts in your mouth. The sandwich and chicken were delicious. The patty's were ok. Would love to come back and try more items from the menu and more coco bread..I asked my sister for a local restaurant that serves the best jerk chicken. She immediately said Jackie's on Baychester in the Bronx. I ordered two large jerk chicken meals with rice and peas and cabbage along with a sorrel ginger drink, everything was delicious. Neither one of us could finish so there's more left for tomorrow. Will definitely be my go to spot!"
"Taiwanese bakery with yummy pastries and stuff that you don't usually see at other Chinese bakeries in NYC. Like pork floss and black sesame pastries :) Support support support!.Cash only, their famous Boston Pie 波斯頓派 is $19.95 as of March 2022. Small space but line moves quickly. They speak English and Mandarin..Still solid, and it turns out if you order enough of something, and they don't have it or they've sold out for the day and it's not too late, they will make a whole new batch for you. This is what happened when we wanted a whole bunch of date pastries, they just made a whole new batch in under three hours for us. Amazing service, but only cash so keep that in mind as I hadn't expected to drop $72 for pastries today, but they are really darn good..I have to say, the date filled pastries I've tried since are top notch according to those familiar to the scene and they are friendly and can handle cash only. They have cakes, too.  While I don't like everyone I've tried, quality has been good and that's important for the family..Taiwanese bakery that's hard to see if you're not paying attention - a tiny doorway in and then access to baked goods.It's not cheap, and the bubble tea is a bit overly sweet, but there are pastries here you are unlikely to find elsewhere in the metropolitan area that are quite tasty. Mooncakes, sun cakes, and more. Will have to try some of the fresh breads and rolls the next time I go.Lots of people coming to pick up orders, I noticed (cakes and more).I also like the fact that the scallion bun I tried was in a sealed bag. No fly issues here!.Absolutely the best mooncake I have ever had in my life. I'm not usually a fan of mooncake but my mom picked up a box for me for Mid autumn festival celebration. I was pleasantly surprised about how good it tasted. They have different flavors ranging from pineapple, taro, chestnut, green tea, and your typical lotus one. I'm actually gonna go buy another box when I'm done with this one for other family members to try..Best tasting Asian bakery in Flushing. Small place, but all the pastries and sweets taste great. This was the first time I have enjoyed their baked goods, and they will be our goto bakery from now on....Come her for the Bao Wan (Taiwanese gelatin meatball) every weekend. No other place does it right as they do. The best!!.My coworker gave me some of their bakeries from this store. So delicious and I will definitely go there to buy more..Queens local brought us here and apparently this place has been in Flushing for over 30 years! He loves the cake bun, so our group all had to try it. It's exactly what it sounds like, a piece of cake wrapped in a bun. The cake has condensed milk on the inside so it's a bit sweeter while the bun on the outside adds some firmness. There were a bunch of other pastries that you typically would find at a Chinese bakery, but I didn't order any of them. Place is very compact and narrow. Cash only..This place is BY FAR the BEST bakery hands down! I had it since Day 1 since I arrived in NY 20 years ago. Been coming here forever since then. The best asian bread you can find around with friendly service and reasonable price! HIGHLY RECOMMEND+++.I pass by this tiny bakery on a side street 100s times and finally decided to go in. Glad I did. Wednesday is the autumn festival - moon cakes are part of the celebration. I used to buy from Windsor bakery on Kissena but their service is spotty. The service here is very good and attentive. I purchased few different moon cakes - although they all taste really good but my favorite is lotus paste (filling). Taro, greet tea, red bean, ... and ... I don't really like sweet. The darker cake can stay for two weeks and the white one week at room temperate. Happy moon festival and bon appetite."
"Came in and was seated quickly which is definitely a plus. Ordered a shrimp cocktail, steak and beans. The steak and beans were good. The steak was a decent size and well seasoned. The rice and beans were good. Where I take away points is in two places. The shrimp cocktail wasn't very good, the sauce was a little bland and the shrimp wasn't as chilled as it should be. The other point is it was cold in the restaurant. It feels as if the windows and door aren't well shut or insulated letting the cold and in and making the food get colder faster.All in all I will go back when it is warmer..Placed a to-go order for an $18 shrimp in garlic sauce platter. Please tell me why there were a total of six shrimp in the platter?! No, not jumbo shrimp. Smh. Beyond irritated and disappointed. Additionally, the food was bland; needless to say, I won't be returning to this establishment..Best pupusas  in Brooklyn ny  I recommend this place to everyone is near by................Enchiladas were especially tasty, but the chicken tamales were also really goodShrimp was pretty tasty as well, prices are cheap as well.  No complaints!.Been waiting 45 min for my order to be told that they haven't started my order due to a lost ticket. I was told wait time was 15-20 min, I gave them an extra 10 min grace period just in case they left fell behind in the kitchen. I asked her to give me my refund when I was told that they are starting to prepare my food, instead she brushed me away and went to the back. Don't waist your time here go to usulteco instead on 40st and 5 ave. Quicker service and better prices overall..I'm not a big fan of their rice and beans, it's kinda of bland to me. However, I mixed it with my shrimp and garlic sauce and I loved it! For me it was pretty filling I couldn't finish it, so I took the rest to go.I like how there fried cheese is not too salty. In my opinion it goes better without the ketchup..Yum! Their pupusas are great! So happy to have found this place. Delicious beans too! I heart Salvadoran food!!.I LOVE this place. The Pupusas the the Bomb. Fanicer dishes like steaks are...fine. but it's all about the pupusas. I dream about them..I think about these pupusas daily, probably the best in NY. Totally worth the trek if you're far. I like stopping by a few times a year even though I've moved just for pupusas. If you try anything else on their menu it is also good, filling, big portions. But....the pupusas, they're literally perfect..The best popusa place in brookyln and New York I'll say I've tried others and there bad love them"
"Nice Starbucks. Just wish there was more seating. My drink was ready after ordering on the app in the time stated. However they are Not being very diligent about checking Vax cards..We have been working from home since last year so we haven't visited this location in a while. The decor is cozy and wide-spaced after its renovation during the pandemic. We were there for their 50 years anniversary special blend, which is a retro blend from 25 years ago. There is a couple of things in this collection but we only got the beans. The smell is refreshing and we can't wait to try it at home..Came here with a friend on Saturday and this place was a disaster. First of all, shout out to the short white girl that was wearing a white beanie. She was the only person there that was actually doing something. This poor girl had to make all the drinks by herself, where at the same time, her coworkers were all standing there doing little something. During the 40+mins wait, that poor girl made like 20 drinks all by herself. Her coworkers, skinny black young girl, standing there pretending she was busy, refused to help out other customers when being asked. Chubby Latino guy, tried to make one drink,  but didn't know how to, asked the short white girl for help, and then went back to the cashier and take orders when there was 1 or two customers there. After he helped the two, he stood by this chubby black lady who was washing and wiping the counter over and over again very slowly, and started chatting and laughing when this poor little white girl was running around making 20+ drinks. I'm not sure if she's being bullied or if it's actually them purposely taking turns like that, but will never come back to this place again. No wonder the ratings here are so low lol. Thumbs up to that short white girl again, forgot to ask for her name..Worst customer service. Workers are rude. They would rather talk to each other then help customers. Overheard a worker saying she's over this place. Don't come here ever. I wish I could give this place no stars. My advice, fire everyone here and start with a new staff. Or better yet, just close this location completely..They're disorganized and rude. Drinks take forever and when a mobile order is finally ready they call out your name and put it just behind the counter where only staff can go. When you try to get their attention they ignore you!!! So guess you just have stare at your drink right in front of you for ten minutes until one of them bothers to acknowledge the crowds of people gathering by the pick up counter for their now cold drinks??.40 minutes to get a drink they forgot to make and the barista behind the bar is Lazy AF.Honestly, if I could give a 0 star rating, I would. First, I'd like to address the lack of support their staff gives to any customers. As a barista myself, from an actual coffee shop in Honolulu, at one of the biggest and busiest locations, I understood if they were busy and busting their balls working--but picture this: it was 745 and slow, no one was in there. Customer service was terrrrrible!!! The closing crew sucked. The barista was amazing, but the support crew sucked. She said, ""she hates working at this location"" AND to top it off, instead of tending to customers, she tended to her friend who was visiting. My simple iced tea drink took more than 10 minutes and she kept warning us, ""we're closing!!"". She also turned away a customer who came in before closing. It was terrible. Service was terrible. I would never visit again:) and I hope management figures it out because they really sucked :) they made New Yorkers seem rude!.Trash, dude behind the counter got all pissy cause I checked to see if it was my drink or not. Yeah the staff is very unfriendly and rude. Stop by here if you wanna risk getting your drink spit in..Came here the morning around 10 AM to grab some coffee before I had to run some errands. This Starbucks was very spacious. However, every seat was taken already by people.As I walked in I hear one of the baristas shouting free frappe for anyone who comes first to get it. The cashier that took my order greeted me but was not very warming. I ordered a caramel macchiato with almond milk. She didn't bother saying thank you or next. She just stared at me until I walked away. I got my drink fairly fast. When I was waiting for my drink, one of the baristas came out with food orders that customers requested and hand delivered it to them. This is the first Starbucks branch where the barista hands the food to the customer. Most Starbucks employees just called the customers name and wait for them to pick it up themselves. The employee who handed me my drink was a lot nicer than the cashier. Overall the environment was very clean but it's a busy branch so it's hard to find seats..This Starbucks is a little bit different- it doesn't have easy WiFi . You have to get a code to put into your WiFi- not sure why. Again this is a highly trafficked Starbucks so the line is always long here for the restrooms. I was happy to come here and get my favorite pomegranate iced tea and chat with my daughter for a bit. Sometime I wonder if Starbucks tries some things that could be different in some locales-I wish they would"

"My favorite Connecticut Muffin and that's saying something as the Windsor Terrace CT & the  Cortelyou Road CT are so wonderful.Reasons this place is great:My favorite tasting Ice coffee Ever!!!Great mini muffins ...the cranberry is the bestFantastic service even when the place is busy...shout out to the ladies behind the counter who do an incredible jobDelicious breakfast sandwiches.No stars Asked if muffin had nuts & guy behind counter said nopeDaughter ate it (was full of nuts) and had severe reactionThanks Connecticut Muffin you suck.Jerk customers makes for jerky customer service.Locals act entitled and run you over to get in only to take forever to order. When it was my turn I simply said it looks like you grabbed the wrong muffin for me only for the counter service to say sheesh and Aye Aye Aye to reach in and squash my muffin and say See I grabbed the right one. Who needs this kind of rude to start their morning!.I love LOVE their decaf hazelnut iced coffee here! It is the only place in the neighborhood that I have found to not only have decaf iced coffee but also a flavored one! The hazelnut flavoring is not too sweet so it is just right. They have sandwiches to bagels to pastries. There is also a fairly large area for benches in front of the restaurant that is partly shielded by their awning to sit and eat. On a nice day, it is great for sitting outside and sipping your drink or eating breakfast while people or car watching. It is across the street from a school and the school's playground so it is a convenient place to stop by after the playground and get a snack or a drink. The prices are comparable to neighborhood coffee shops..I can honestly say I only come here because I love their muffins - BUT  - Staff is rude- Rude - Tend to run out of certain muffins early in the morning.Great place to grab coffee at a reasonable price. Cute Small outside and inside seating area. They serve cupcakes cookies and other pastries which looked really good but I would definitely stop by for iced coffee again. They do have an almond milk option..I got here a little early on a weekday morning. They open at 6 and I got there at 5:55 and asked if they're open yet. The man opening on 01/09/20 said only coffee for now so I asked if he will have vanilla chai at 6. He assured me, ""yes 6 o clock"" so I went back into the car to give him some more time to set up. I came in again around 6:03 and he proceeded to give me attitude and say ""you think I'll have it ready this early ??????? It takes 30 minutes the machine isn't working"" even though he's the one who told me he will have it at 6. A vanilla chai is made by mixing a powder and milk together....what machine isn't working?????? Even if there was an misunderstanding he did not have to be rude about it and even GET IN MY FACE with attitude. What kind of customer service is that????? I left my house so early to give them business because I genuinely enjoyed their vanilla chai but given this mans attitude I'd rather go to the Starbucks across the street. Good job ruining someone's morning Connecticut Muffin!!!.Expensive, bad service, average food. Probably the worst service I've experienced at a cafe. Also got Irritated when I didn't hear what she asked me lol. Would've given no stars if I could.  The matcha latte was okay, not worth the price..Terrible service, rude cashier with an attitude who's trying to do thousand things at the same time, but none of them is done properly and as a cherry on a pie, because of the above - the slowest line ever. Go there if you want to kill your morning mood. Never again!.Had the most God-awful cappuccino here. I had forgotten that coffee could be so bad. How does a place like this stay in business? Do better."
"Murray's is an authentic New York bagel operation. I respect their huge selection of lox preparations and schmears. They got my order right and the wait wasn't too long. But...I didn't love the bagel.Partly, I think their bagels are on the sweet side, which is a thing a lot of bagel shops do. Maybe the issue was that the bagel was not also salty - I got an everything bagel, and it seems like their ""everything"" does not include salt. The texture was good, though.Another reason I simply cannot give a fifth star is because they are unnecessarily packing every order in a plastic bag! What the heck? A couple of bagels in a paper bag do not need an over-bag. Finally, some ordering advice: ask them for ""just a little cream cheese"" unless you want to eat a whole brick of it. Like many places, they over-apply, but unlike other places, they will honor your request that they go easy on the schmear..$1.75 for a friggin bagel?  Are you insane!  Must be Putin's Price hike..LMAOI don't care how good it is (after all it's only a bagel, fer Chrys sake) I aint paying $1.75 nor should anybody sane.I should've read the reviews before going. The menu is confusing - they keep talking about sandwiches on the wall. I wish they would call them Bagels. I just don't think of a bagel as a sandwich but ok. They've also got a range of cream cheese flavours but you wouldn't be able to tell based on the menu on the wall. It just really isn't well laid out for the customer.So I ordered an onion bagel with lox and plain cream cheese. The bagel itself had good texture, but was WAY too salty (I could honestly say I think they put a whole tsp of salt into each bagel. It wasn't even the fish that was salty, it was the bagel itself. And I'm not too salt sensitive but this had me running for water... So I half ate the bagel, left the rest and ate the fish. A shame! The second bagel I tried was supposed to be cinnamon raisin with strawberry cream cheese. Well they got the strawberry cream cheese part right. And put it on a poppyseed bagel instead. Like who would want strawberry cream cheese on poppy? Really? Weird. The staff were nice that took the order. But clearly someone can't tell a poppyseed from a raisin!But yeah, sadly I doubt I'll go back. Which was a shame - the shop itself looks lovely..Excellent bagels. I love NYC bagels and get one every weekend at my favorite Brooklyn bagel place but this weekend I tried Murray's and loved it. I got the multigrain bagel with Scallion Tofu Cream Cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. The bagel was soft and chewy even though it was toasted, there was a perfect amount of cream cheese, and they did not skimp on the veggies. Really excellent bagel and I'll definitely be back.Look no further for a delicious bagel than with Murray's bagels.You can't go wrong with bagels in NYC. Murray's bagel is a staple where the bagels have the perfect texture and an outside crunch. The inside is soft and it perfectly allows the spread to coat it. My review for Murray's is largely due to the variety options of delicious spreads. Some of my favorites are the lox spreads and jalapeño/pepper ones - seriously the jalapeño was so so delicious. Adding too much spread will make it a messy eat but the flavor makes up for it!.Is it just me or are their menus confusing? There were about 3 different menus to look at - one on the wall, one above the display, and one behind the cashier. I ordered a lox bagel with tofu cream cheese on a pumpernickel bagel which cost $14. My friend got the traditional lox on an everything bagel. It wasn't clear to me how exactly my specific order was calculated from looking at their menus. The bagels were yummy, but the salmon was incredibly salty. The tofu cream cheese was interesting - it had a barely-there tofu taste and had a thicker consistency than regular cream cheese. I might come back just for the bagels but won't be getting the lox again..Bagel delivery :Don't feel like it was toasted but I guess that's a delivery problem.Herring Salad: overly greasy and sweet. Megillah: too much cucumber and tomato so barely could taste the smoked salmon.Cappuccino is just like regular deli coffee :/.Be prepared for a wait! Overall fluffy bagels with a good amount of cream cheese (not overly stuffed) and fresh tasting egg whites which is great if you want something different than whole eggs..If it wasn't for the fact that I've heard this place is popular I probably wouldn't have gone based on the reviews alone. As I was standing in line (which was nearly out the door) scrolling this I was tempted to back out. But I persisted and so hears my review. My 3 star experience is based on the food alone. The line issue: It was long sure. It took me maybe 20 minutes so I didn't have an issue. It moved quickly. The customer service: Fine honestly, I have no qualms. Ordered: Sesame Bagel not toasted with avocado smear. How long did it take: literally 5 minutes. Maybe because I got such a simple order but the speediness is an anomaly in comparison to the other reviews. How was it?: The avocado was more plain than if I had an unripened avocado. Crazy. It was essentially described as guac but yeah it was so plain. Vibes: 5/5 they have cute outdoor seating. Like full blown tables and benches which is nice. Unfortunately not coming back. Too hyped and overpriced for what?.What a long line to order and then to wait to pick up. It's like assemble to grab the bagel bags! Well worth the time, I suppose. Warm bagels and wide selections of spreads and meat styles to choose from - especially how the salmon is  made. Yum and nom when received."
"This my home bar, so maybe I'm a little biased but this is your perfect neighborhood bar. Always a smile from the bartenders and Pam & Chris always make you feel at home. The have a great happy hour, a good pool table, lots of TV's everywhere and are almost always open till 4am. Pam & Chris, Love you guys!.Stopped by for a few drinks before our movie started and everyone was super friendly. Filled with happy locals and a quick bartender, I will definitely be back if I'm in the area. They even offered an Irish meal for St Paddy's Day/weekend! There's a pool table in the back room and game machines up front. This place gives off a cozy vibe like you're in a small town in Maine..do not go here. no one is social distancing. no one is wearing a mask. the owners don't give a shit about your health. they only want your money. don't go there to die and don't go there to pick up the virus and kill your family and friends..I'm not surprised to see PC's not yet listed on Yelp; when nearly every other bar in Bay Ridge has made the grade. PC's crowd is not really a 'Yelp' kinda crowd; they're not interested in changing their routine; moving from place-to-place; sampling other bar choices; etc That would all be considered disloyalty; 'jumping ship'. And honestly, PC's is just as good as anywhere else. For what you probably want out of it. And its nice to see regular faces every weekend. Plus, this is a family-owned bar; a neighborhood institution. You gonna go against that? If so, then you're not really the PC's type of drinker, and good riddance to ye kid, you're probably a 'Sloper'.For me, PC's charm waxes and wanes. It holds its own against the onslaught of muslim stores now invading the block; it holds its own vs upscale 'Schnitzel Haus' a few doors down. Its essentially on the same par as Killarney's and the Leif bar--both nearby dives--good ones--longstanding neighborhood fixtures. In fact, the typical evening crowd can often be the same folks --just spread out among all three spots.  PC's is probably the brightest and cheeriest of the three--gets the most sun--nevertheless, its a sort of dusty, old-coat-closet-type place; so hum-drum that only 'regulars' (serious Ridge drinkers) even know about it. They wander in at 11 am on Sunday mornings even--right after church. But you don't have to dress up to come in here, let's put it that way. All these are bars so seedy and mothballed and used-up that even the dust--has dust on it. How long has it been since PC's changed its sign? Or any of the bathroom fixtures? Or the kitsch behind the bar? No one knows. Yet, every holiday the place is bubbling with enthusiasm and people-in-plaid slapping each other on the back. Every gameday there are Giants/Jets/Mets/Yanks pennants and jerseys galore. Its the kind of place where folks get together and take a bus to Atlantic City every month.The crowd is older. Let's be frank about this. I'm talking OLD. Older'n Methuselah. Just kiddin'...everyone's still pretty lively and spry. Just don't expect hot babe-glances across the crowded room. Don't expect romance to bloom in the glow of the wall-mounted 'NY Lotto' monitor. The up-side to this, is that there's less stupid shenanigans that infest other bars. You can come in and have a quiet pint if that's what you want--or, if you're in the mood for debate, you can challenge what really started the 'Korean Police Action' --and find plenty of stubby fingers being poked vigorously into your chest, you young whippersnapper!Beer selection: limited.  Coors, Bud, Miller, Blue Moon, Stella, Heineken. What can you do about it? Nothing.Buybacks: will happen if you behave courteously and do not ask for them, do not expect them. Bartender's discretion. Regulars get plenty of leeway. Intangibles: billiards. Table isn't *too* off-kilter.  Patio seating out back? Not sure.Food: none. Except, a large and free hot buffet on NFL gamedays. Usually wings. This is a wonderful bargain.Music: up until recently I would have said; 'good'. Because they had a standard computerized juke. But now, PC's has jumped-the-shark and switched to a disgusting juke which looks like a cellphone. How the hell is a man supposed to deal with this effeminate nonsense? Yes, it really irks me that much.Overall: PC's used to be a great bar where you could heal up; nurse various wounds and scars received in the course of a typical jangling week in New York. Soothing, unchanging. A place where no storm wind could really enter. Now...eh..somewhat questionable....great laid back bar, cool crowd great staff.I grew up in the neighborhood and this place captures the spirit of Bayridge...... Simultaneously changing and staying the same, just like Brooklyn. A great mix of old and new..... A place to have a quiet drink and contemplate or engage in conversation.......your senses won't be attacked by a bass pounding DJ , but there is appropriate volume jukebox background music and live music as advertised..... You can stop in and get caught up on local news, enjoy a drink or watch a game.......you don't have to be from the neighborhood to feel at home in PCs.....owners are usually on premise and welcoming of clientele without being overbearing...... A great place to unwind..Bay Ridge has a ton of sports bars, and this is another one I would add to my list if I was making the rounds. No frills. TV's at the front of the bar, tables surrounding it, and Bud on tap. Prerequisites for a solid bar. You can tell there are definitely regulars who make that place their haunt. While the bartender gave my friends and I a disconcerting look, seemingly unsure if we were going to rob the place or order a beer, we all were able to be served and watched some bowl games here over the weekend. I chalk that up to us probably being the youngest people that have gone in that place in awhile. The older bartender is affable, and offered a buyback on three purchased beers, so you know the place knows how the business works. No food that I can see, but if I lived here, I'd be going a lot. Don't go here expecting some Top 40 on the very modern digital jukebox that takes credit cards, or really any women to speak of, just let the classic rock music play and enjoy the ride..A neighborhood staple both if you are looking for a quiet drink or some friends  to chat with.  Always friendly, fairly priced...stay for 1 or 10..With an acquaintance, I was asked to check out on this place.I don't think this person was coming here very long, from observance. This is a small bar with larger than life prices, the bar is extremely noisy and  extremely inquisitive , I always thought  woman were busy bodies... the men here top them.It's an aquarium of assorted broken individuals, rude, loud, 50 questions, the non relaxed and the unrehearsed, and individuals who think they can drill theowner, and an owner who knows how to toy?I also got to meet the walking encyclopedia, who knows just about everything fromsports to the beyond, and the alpha male who feels he hardly pays a cent for hisdrinks and possesses the keys to the kingdom, don't bet too long.To me going in here was one shot test night and one of the biggest cancellations.Someone had said there was food here: self serve. With today's germs that putshygene to the test, especially what creature features that crawl in.You need to bring your resume, face book page, and please bring a face mask.If you stay here and study long enough, this place will consume as your guideand make the next place in your search the winner."
"Me & my coworkers come here almost every other Friday for Happy Hour & we've always been treated with kindness. The service is fast, food is great and always fresh. Them dranks though?!! We try other happy hours at other establishments but always end up back at BB because their drinks give what you expect them to giveeee! I love it here!.I was visiting My friend on Staten Island, we wanted to go out for drinks and I remember when I used to live on the island I loved going to the burrito bar. After several years of not eating here  things have changed while other things remain the same. The quality of the food is not the same. My friend and I was seated at the bar, and we weren't really feeling the energy from the bartender, can't really call it but it seems as if we were a bother to him, almost as if he had an attitude.  It seems to be a mix crowd. Mixture of after work crowed and then you have the losers who do not know how to handle their alcohol.  I ordered buffalo wings, when they arrived they barely had any buffalo sauce on them... what kinda madness is that?  The frozen drinks are great if I come back here it would be just to get drinks and go because while we were there a fight broke out between a guy in the girl he was with The guy then turned on one of the workers of the establishment. It was just too much! All I wanted was to enjoy my food my drinks and a nice vibeThe corniness of Staten Island is just unbearable..I can't believe I've been a regular off and on here for as many years as I have and never left them a review. I enjoy a romantic brunch or early dinner date with the Mr. here and we also visit with the full family. The drinks are good, huge selection. Some of my favorite foods are the wings, nice and crispy, they never disappoint. And also ""fire"" bacon wrapped shrimp. The fajitas and all the fishes are great. And finish the meal off with a Mexican coffee. I'd have to say this place both when indoors was a thing, and their outside yard is a comfortable casual environment. Somehow they always have my favorite music playing. This place is my true zen zone. Lol.It was quite delicious. And they were able to accommodate a dairy free option. Would definitely combe here again when in the neighborhood.Oh my God, Burrito Bar and Restaurant was truly great. I've never had a bad experience with them, never tried something I didn't love. They have a fantastic menu as well. Team are very lovely and service is really fast. Burrito Bar and Restaurant I'm telling all my friends to check you out..Great food. Friendly people. Loved their outdoor dining area. Will come back again and will recommend it to friends and family..Just came back from being seated outdoors; we've been here plenty of times before. As soon as we sit we are told the following:""you have an hour and a 45 minutes to eat and then you have to leave."" REALLY!  I go out to be served food food in a good atmosphere and enjoy myself; not look at my watch while I'm spending my money. I call over the manager to let her know my thoughts about what we were told (or rather how it was said) and she barely let me get a word out while trying to explain and defend what we were told. Managers should have listening skills. I wanted nothing else but to be heard They make awesome frozen margaritas!!'  Second to none. They also make this appetizer called Fire which I could eat everyday. OMG so good. 5 shrimp and cheese stuffed jalapeños wrapped in bacon and then fire roasted. Taco salad with ground beef- the edible taco bowl was sitting in refried beans so the whole thing got super mushy on the bottom. Nachos with chicken were good; all the chicken was on the bottom. Queso Fundido is a large portion of a cheesy bean dip for a very reasonable price.  Like I told the manager, after hearing what was said when we were first seated, I'll be thinking twice about going back.Very nice and spacious backyard on a beautiful night.  Service was spot on.  Cocktails were well made.  Wifey had a Maui wawi and I had a Fridas revenge.  We shared fish tacos and pork burrito.  Fish tacos were good and the pork burrito was nice and large with a generous amount of very tender pork.  We'll be back!.Taryn was an amazing server so attentive and inviting and efficient. Losing her would be the worst thing for this restaurant. The food was flavorful and came so quick! The drinks were delicious and gets you right. Definitely suggest this place to anyone and ask for taryn.I love this place. The servers are super nice and attentive. The rest of the staff are great as well. And the food is tasty and their drinks are top notch. My one issue is that the portions seem to be getting skimpier. I ordered the fish tacos and there was a small piece of fish in each of the two tacos. I'm not knowledgeable about the business end of a restaurant, but one bad experience can ruin a place. And my gf never wants to go back because she feels the owners are being stingy. And I can't say I disagree with her."
"Located under the El train on Westchester Ave, this is one of many places to pick and taste Latin food. The place has a decent selection of fried yummies such as .... alcapuria, relleno de papa, pastelillos, fried chicken, pernil, ribs, chicharon and more.They've also got unbelievably priced package deals of family meals which ever you prefer.The service is awesome as long as you understand Spanish and parking may be an issue as this is a very busy area..My whole family got sick from the fried chicken, roast pork, pastles and rice and beans. I still feel horrible 2 days later. Don't go here.The food not fresh.. they tell you the price when the train is passing... Son unos tramposos!!!!.I was in town from San Francisco California, after spending the entire day exploring New York. On our way back to Boston mass we stopped here. I took at look at everything they had and I wasn't impressed. So I decided to try their alcapurrias. They were disgusting, mainly masa no meat. The meat that was in it I couldn't tell you what kind it was even though she said it was ""carne"". Being Puerto Rican I thought this place was a bad look for Puerto Rican's..you can get a whole meal here for a family for cheap. Purchased a whole chicken, bowl of red beans, salad and a heaping of white rice for $16. Most food here is not made to order but it's plenty busy and the food moves quickly so they're always bringing out fresh stuff. Pretty tasty and filling. Only downfall is the salt they pour in to the food. Convenient spot for wholesome, cheap spanish food on the fly..She took my money and gave me a stale, hard bacalaito.  Don't do this to your business.  Show pride in your food and care for your customers.  Gave an extra star because I have gotten good cuchifritos here in the past (over a year ago).  What happened?.This place is disgusting. Found a bug in my food and when I showed it to the lady working there she took the plate went to the back picked the bug out with her finger and added a little more beans and came back to me. After telling her off I demanded my money back and left. WOULD NEVER COME HERE..Great deals on combos, my go-to place when I want to pick up something quick to feed the family and don't have the energy to cook.  Everything I have had here is delicious comfort food.   I'm a fan of their roast and fried chicken, beans and rice, fried plantains, and the cuchifritos.  Bring your appetite, the menu is predominantly starchy fried items on the menu which are extremely filling.  The upside is that there are usually leftovers..Their chicken use to be so juicy back in 2012 but I think they recently changed because their fruit punch is basically water and they tried to serve me some pink pernil that was almost all fat. But besides these incidents, the food is always good just make sure the nice Spanish ladies are the one who set up the food for you cus the bitchy ones really don't care..I give this place a 0 I bought a stew chicken with yellow rice and peas and the chicken had blood inside of it(chicken thigh and chicken leg) will not be going back here and they are very rude I called to speak to a manager or someone who speaks English and the lady told me no and that their was no manager there."

"Discovered this place just today and I could not be happier I decided to stop in. I was looking to try a new restaurant in the UWS and since I had not known about it previously, after checking out their menu and solid ratings I decided to go for it. My girlfriend and I shared the Turkey burger and also the fried chicken entre and we loved every bite more than the last! The fried chicken came with two sides - we chose the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes which were some of the best I have ever had for each. The Turkey burger was served with fries and again, a truly incredible meal option. Highly recommend and can't wait to go back!.Man those jerk wings were CRAZY!!!I loved the vibes they had playing over the loud speaker, everybody in there were jamming and singing to the oldies.  Dope atmosphere...dope service...I'll definitely be back if you'll have me.One time for New York...A much anticipated visit to this iconic venue was an utter disappointment from the menu and service. The blackened catfish was bland and undercooked and probably should have been sent back. My friend's catfish Meunière was deep fried with a dollop of sauce on the top.  Beef tacos were dry and over cooked. Sides  were fine but nothing memorable. In general, all our dishes were passable but nothing we would order again..The jerk chicken wings were cooked perfectly. And the green were some of the best we've had. I would say the crab stuffed shrimp was fine, although a bit too peppery. We will return for the greens and the nice ambience indoors..I visited this lovely establishment for a birthday celebration. The birthday boy was running late (about 45 minutes late unfortunately) but the staff definitely made me feel welcomed as I waited. The bartender was super friendly and great at sparking a conversation. He even shared with me that he is actually a singer and gave me a sneak peak to his vocals! I also had a drink at the bar which was refreshing and had the right amount of alcohol to help me forget that I was even waiting. The food tasted great! I had the pork chops which was a great choice. The ambiance gives a romantic vibe with the dim lights and intimate size. Their bathroom was also very pretty as well in which I enjoyed the ceiling mirror. All in all, I'd definitely recommend..Wanted to come here to celebrate my mom's 70th birthday.  They were closed on Monday but I still left a message. I received a call back early Tuesday morning from Demaria (not sure of spelling). She was awesome. She made our reservations.  It's hard coordinating a large group sometimes so we had lots of changes and each change the person I spoke with was super accommodating.  We arrived late! Very late. But they were still holding our table.  The service alone warranted 5 stars but add in the food and it's 5+.  We got the fried chicken, the pork chops, the salmon, the fish tacos, the lamb chops, the spring rolls and the habanero wings. For dessert we got the bread pudding and the key lime pie.  The fried chicken was the star. Crunchy yet super tender.  My son loved the spring rolls and wings.  The lamb chops were tasty and a great price.  What needed a bit of help was the spinach. It just needed some salt.  I brought it home to fix it up so no big deal.  I wasn't crazy about the fish taco but it was ok bc the person that ordered them liked them.  I'm  not a fan of corn tortillas and I was expecting it to be fried.  The bread pudding and key lime pie were delicious.  Bread pudding super flavorful not soggy and not dry.  Perfect texture. One thing I will say is I kind of expected them to do something special for her birthday but to be fair I didn't ask. In Ga when you mention you're celebrating a birthday they do it automatically so that's my fault.  I would definitely return when we come back to New York..Let me start by saying the music was phenomenal. I went on Motown Friday and the band and singers were great. The service was horrible. I met my cousin at the bar. We were able to get a table. It took over 29 minutes for the waitress to come. After ordering our food, it to almost an hour for the food to arrive. They offered drinks or desert to make it up, but we declined.  I would come again for the music. But, although the food was good.... I waited way too long to get it..I made dinner reservations for Valentine's Day weekend which was the start of Nyc's indoor dining. I initially was told that reservations for indoor seating was already booked and that only outdoor seating was available. I got a call informing me that someone canceled and I could be seated inside. I arrived but I didn't like the inside of the restaurant. It looked a little raggedy. It was empty and all the tables and chairs was pushed and stacked in the back like they weren't open for indoor dining. And the lighting was horrible. It was Very dim and dreary looking. The outdoor seating was set up pretty nicely so we opted to sit outside.They have big heaters inside of an enclosed structure that's covered with plastic. Good music playing, real candles on the table, and a nice surrounding of lush green plants. Not sure if they were real but they looked nice. It was pretty warm and cozy.The waiter took my order fairly quickly and the food came out delicious and hot. They have an online menu which is totally different from the menu they have currently at the restaurant. I was told that the menu online is a really old menu.It was a great dinner given the circumstances of being out in the cold. The food was delicious and that's all that ever really matters..The service, music and atmosphere delivered. My boyfriend came out look for a nice place for dinner and found ASSF. I checked the website, Facebook and instagram and found the most current information ( which a I really appreciated). We were seated quickly and our found came out hot, fresh and quickly. My only suggestion is that the Mac cheese was not seasoned. Everything else was awesome!!  I will return on my next visit to NYC!!.This place got four stars because of the food. I went there last night and I have the day the service isn't great. We waited in our server for quite sometime on end, he did say he was the only server and bartender but as an establishment they should work on this, ideally for a Friday night at a popular spot. The food was really good! I mean if the service and the food were in the same level, I'd give this place over 5 stars! The lamb chops were savory and tender. The Mac and cheese was delectable and you could tell they used a variety of cheese. The collard greens oooooo the COLLARD GREENS were the best part! It was smoked to perfection and tasty!"
"Cute little neighborhood irish pub that has fun events almost everyday of the week!Went for an open mic night to see a friend perform and the stage set up is great and the bar is open and quite big. They also now sell hard seltzer which is always a plus for a basic girl like me..2 stars bc my friend said it was fun around midnight on a Friday night.  My friend was there and they wouldn't let me in at 3am on a ""friday"" night, even though it says they close at 4am. Not only that but they were very rude about it and shooed me out the door. I was just trying to see my friend. Rotund guy with glasses-stay away, very rude..What a fun time we had a Paddy's!!! What can I tell you...  We came across this pub accidentally, as it was around the corner from our Airbnb, east side of Manhattan. We didn't know we had discovered a jewel at the time. This is a traditional old school Irish pub with live Celtic music and home for aspiring musicians.  A local pub where folks know each other, yet, they made us feel right at home.  Brian, the bartender, was terrific.  Super friendly, attentive, and a master in the art of pouring a Guinness.  We met John Syze, a local fellow who made the experience even more fun.  Did I mention affordable spirits and hops? New York can go crazy with prices of beer.  Not this place!  One of the highlights of our trip to NYC..The bartenders are pretty rude--typical NYC Irish pub. Nothing to see here. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless this is your absolute last option..Getting off the bus to go walk over to Kalustyan's for some shopping, I saw this bar with its Guinness sign, and decided I could use a pint or two of Guinness stout, so I stopped in. The place has a good, traditional bar look to it, and Nick the bartender was super nice. Everything was cool, but after a couple of well poured pints and some good conversation with Nick, I had to be on my way. I will definitely be returning to this establishment, as it was an inviting and friendly place. It's nice to have found a good bar with well poured Guinness for when I shop in the area..Love this spot. Sooo chill. No judgement zone . . Friendly staff. Friendly patrons. Lots and lots of Guinness and Jameson's. If you are into pina coladas and margarita go somewhere else.The happy hour starts at 11am... say no more...bring your own food . Drink until your hearts content.  Came on Wednesday... open Mic. ..quite entertaining.  From the entertainment to the hecklers. Had a great time. Great crowd . Great service. Great drinks. Great time.. Love this place..If you like Guinness liked I do, Paddy Reilly is your  bar to go to.  The staff is friendly with a great smile serving up a cold pint.  The juke box is always kicking.  The night I visited the bar there was a live band but that was jamming and people were dancing to footloose.  I swear I thought I saw Kevin Bacon was kicking it..We snapped a photo of Brian because he was awesome! We were so thankful to find an Irish pub within walking distance from our hotel. The drink prices were some of the most reasonable we found over our weekend in NYC and Brian was one of the most friendliest bartenders. He was welcoming, hilarious and told us all about his time in NYC. The bar never got too crowded either and we were able to enjoy our conversation. He even played one of my favorite artists over the music.  Just an all around great bar and we will definitely go back if and when we are ever in NYC again..Proper pint of Guinness, friendly shit talking amongst regulars and staff, live music. If you need anything else to have a good time we are very likely not friends. A true gem of NYC..I came here to check out an open mic. It was pretty empty when I first came in but I made it before the end of happy hour (7pm). Eventually people starting pouring in like the pints of Guinness.The regulars I met were very friendly and the place really has that family vibe. Warmed up really quickly and felt comfortable performing. Met some other cool musicians.No food is served here, but you can bring your own. There are even menus you can use.I am definitely coming back here for another open mic. Hope to see some of you there as well. Cheers!"

"I give five stars for the taste of the food but four stars overall. They have the best bagels including taste, texture, seasoning and bite! Amazing, hands-down. My go to is there everything bagel which is perfectly seasoned with the correct balance of toppings including salt which is very important. Most places don't salt their bagels enough. I give four stars overall because the place even after Cove it has slow down still does not allow seating and their service is pretty slow, and attentive and not the friendliest. Nonetheless, worth the trip because the baked goods and prepared salads and cream cheeses are so great!.Huge selections of bagels and cream cheese .. But you will need to wait as there is a long waiting lines so don't come in hungry or too hungry.I have passed by this place many times but since it closes early I never had a chance to stop by. This place gets really busy. We were lucky to have come here and ordered before the line formed. The line was literary out the door. They have many choices of cream cheese spreads and bagels. They also have a good selection of pastries. I ordered 2 sausage egg and cheese on an everything bagel, regular cream cheese on everything bagel, regular cream cheese on cinnamon raisin bagel and bacon egg and cheese on a roll. (Toasted bagel for all) I also ordered an iced chocolate brownie coffee. First off the food came out hot and smelled really good. We had our sandwiches after we got home so it cool. Since the bagel was toasted it started to get hard (but it was still okay). I think the everything bagel was too strong for the sausage egg and cheese. It tasted like burnt garlic. (Next time I would try it on a plain bagel) I had the cream cheese bagel much later and the bagel was more on the hard side. I think it would've been much better when we ate it fresh and hot. The coffee was no good. There was no brownie flavor in it. It just tasted like really water down coffee. Although my first experience was just mediocre I would like to come back and try their flavored cream cheese spread..Been coming here since this place opened in the 90's. Whether coming in for an early morning coffee, bagel, breakfast sandwich, lunch, etc. never had a bad meal or beverage here. Staff is friendly and quick, the menu is pretty big, the online ordering system is a breeze especially during the time of COVID here and it's somewhat centrally located in Whitestone. One of my favorites is their lox bagels; if calories and eating healthy wasn't a thing (lol) I'd have a lox bagel for breakfast everyday from this place! Not the best bagel around - but pretty close!.This is the best bagel spot on the neighborhood hands down, we have a love hate relationship I love the food but I hate that they close early.y typical order is the bacon egg and cheese SPK with a blueberry muffin cut in half grilled with butter, I wish they stayed open longer but still without a doubt 5 stars..Simply amazing New York style bagels.They offers a huge variety of bagels and toppings, hot or cold, they never disappoint.There's always a line during the morning hours, but it moves fairly quick. Staffs are super friendly, and they know all the regulars. I have yet try to order in advance online, perhaps one day..I live close by so I go to this bagel/breakfast regularly. The workers are very nice and accommodating. My bagels always come out great and fast, which is great especially when I wake up grumpy and tired. Will definitely recommend especially if you are close by..Came here on a Wednesday morning (7/8) at 10:30am. We ordered THREE sandwiches. A bacon egg and cheese on a roll, a sausage egg and cheese on a roll and a BLT on a roll. We watched the lady write down our three orders on blue post its. As our order was being packed, I saw only two boxes so I told her we had ordered three sandwiches. My lord. I'm not sure what her name is, but she gave me THE DIRTIEST LOOK (I can even tell with her mask on because her eyes NARROWED) She said she had put sausage inside the bacon egg and cheese. But no... We had seen three sandwich orders being written down and we were clear with our orders. We did not merit that horrible look she gave us. Mistakes happen, I know. But that look? Inexcusable and unnecessary..Disorganized and unfriendly staff. There is no line and system. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a bagel..Bagels are alway fresh. Bacon, Egg and Cheese is always done right. Not a fan of their coffee but that's ok.  Their service is always fast and pleasant and they always get online orders right.Can't ask for more from a NYC local bagel store. Actually I can, which is why I pass two others bagel stores just to go here."
"I didn't have a reservation mistake. I waited over an hour before I got a chair at the bar. I normally don't mind sitting at the bar but the chairs were not comfortable & it was way overcrowded. I started with the tuna tartare it was fair I've at better. Then I opted for the pasta with veal Ragu that was fair also. After three Prosecco I bumped into a friend who had a table & I tried the vanilla cake that was delicious. Overall it was good..You can never go wrong at Cipriani! Upon arrival, I was greeted by a wonderful gentleman named Milton! Milton was delightful! Milton walked us to our table and within 30 secs, a server arrived with menus and got to exceptional service. I don't remember our server's name but it was a young Latin/Hispanic gentleman who was great! We ordered the-DuckNegroni-Whipped Mash-Seafood Pasta-Vanilla meringueEverything was great.I had made a reservation for 8:30 and was not seated until 9:36. This alone caps the review I could give to 2 stars. While I was waiting it was packed at the bar, shoulder to shoulder with waiters trying to get through and patrons trying to get a drink from the bar. I'm not sure what system the front of the house uses to seat people but it seems to be a 'who is famous' or 'who do you know' type deal. And im not going to sit here and debate how the world works, but that's a big reason why I can't leave a positive review of my experience. Management did offer to comp dessert which was nice.If I had to make a suggestion I think this place needs a time limit for dinner service. There were at least 3 tables that we're still there when I had left at ~11. Around 3 hours at a table?!After being seated things went mostly smooth. For appetizers the mozerella was definitely fresh, good stuff there. The carpaccio was also good, good portion size as well. Around this time the manager came over and moved my table as well as the one next to me over so that a table to my right could fit another patron at their table. Didn't really bother me but I could see how someone wouldn't like it. For entrees the veal ravioli was good, flavor portion size, all quality. The pasta was al dente and the sauce was flavorful. Can't complain about the entrees, and the staff did the pasta custom.For dessert the chocolate cake was rich and more or less a classic chocolate cake to me.Overall: good food overshadowed by poor service and poor reservation management on this particular night..You can't go wrong with Cipriani Downtown. The staff always says hello and is friendly. Beautiful people everywhere! A fantastic place to drop in after shopping. Cipriani is also a fun evening dinner spot with friends. Be sure to make a reservation in advance..My first-time Cipriani experience was great. I was very late and they were not happy about it, but thats how I live my life. The service was impeccable throughout the whole experience. The shrimp app was my favorite! We had the wagyu for dinner (which was 40% fat and couldn't be eaten) and the risotto which was amazing. For dessert, I tried their famous vanilla meringue cake and it lived up to the hype. With 4 Bellinis, the bill came out to $285 for two people. I expected this, although I wouldn't say it's entirely worth it. I think a once a year visit is enough here..Started with the fried shrimp with tartare sauce and potato chips-- shrimps were delicious! The potato chips were more like thin French fries. For the main entree, we had the risotto with the wagyu. The serving of risotto was larger than I expected! Wagyu was cooked wonderfully but nothing to rave about. THE DESSERT. Omg. The dessert. The vanilla meringue cake which is their signature dessert was absolutely delicious. It was probably the most memorable of the entire meal. Order it- you won't regret it. For drinks, we stuck with the mimosa. The staff was extremely attentive which I appreciate!I recommend calling to let them know ahead of time if you are running late, they have a 15 min grace period..This place is always going to be super busy because it has the hype! Make sure to make a reservation prior to your visit.The ambiance in the restaurant is charming and authentic. The service is nice, quick, and friendly. For starters, we got the baked eggplant and it was absolutely delicious. It was very hearty and had cheese and other veggies in it too. Definitely one of the best eggplant dishes I have ever had.For entrees, we got the Cipriani organic branzino pasta and it was so good. Cooked al dente and the butter sauce was delicious.We were so stuffed we couldn't get dessert, but next time I will make sure to get their famous vanilla merengue cake!Overall, really happy with my experience here! Can't wait to come back again!!.Decided to do brunch here with a girlfriend and have a few takeaways:Food wise, don't worry. The pasta is fresh, the bread is tasty and the drinks are well mixed. Atmosphere wise...well...it takes itself a little too seriously and so do the people that come to be seen there. There's no space between tables inside so you're basically shoulder to shoulder with those next to you. While this is awkward enough, there's also no dining music so everyone hears everything everyone else is saying if you're loud enough. To be honest, it's more of a place to people watch for the famous and well connected rather than a place to have a chill brunch. Not a bad place to eat, just a bit full of itself. Oh!! This is also NOT the place to go if you're on a budget so go spend your stimulus check somewhere else where you get more bang for your buck....Excellent service!!! Food was ok. We were expecting spectacular, savory, seasoned, delicious food. But, we didn't get that. We don't mind paying $30 for pasta but it better be amazing, and unfortunately this was not tasty or flavorful at all. When we order Bronzino we expect the whole fish to be served and then cut. It was a tiny piece of fish for $50.  Absurd!   Desserts were delicious.  I would also suggest that you greet your customers. We were met at the door by a man who said 'Vaccine Cards!' 'Do you have Reservations?' It might be nice for customers to feel welcome by saying 'Welcome to Cipriani, may I see your vaccine cards please.'Then we didn't know where to go so we went inside and stood around until one of the waiters saw us and helped us to the table..The service was horrible, our waiter forgot about us on several occasions and was arrogant. The endive salad was the best menu item, everything else was average which is unacceptable for the price. We expressed our disappointment at the end of our meal and the manager did not apologize and said we should have said something earlier (even though we tried to but couldn't get anyone's attention!) Overall, wouldn't return or recommend as there are many other Italian restaurants nearby with a better atmosphere, service, food and overall value."
"We were attending a post CoVid wedding reception  we were coming from New Jersey but the directions they gave us were absolutely spot on. Beautiful hall. Staff were incredibly nice. Even the owner was there for a bit to greet guests. The menu was very varied something for everyone though the Chilean sea bass which several of us ordered was very blah but everyone else super enjoyed the other entrees. The serving staff very efficient but not overwhelming in welcome and smiles. Bar staff super nice. Overall a beautiful hall excellent service. Too bad they aren't in Jersey. I'd definitely would book them.To be totally transparent, I had a terrible experience with this establishment. I planned a baby shower, booked it in Feb 2020, for May 2020. After about a month tried to get my money back. I did a charge back with my bank, to no avail. I was planning on go into small claims court, because even though I signed a contract, it was designed to help the business owner recoup losses, but there were none. My family are fortunate that we didn't need the deposit money to pay rent or feed our family. I found that the practices of this establishment, were not empathetic to the events currently occurring in the world. My wife ( my better half) convinced me to have our sons's 1st b day party, and roll over the deposit. I hate to say, we had an amazing experience. This establishment gave us an old world hospitality, that is so uncommon in our world today. Kim was amazing. All of the staff were professional, attentive and exceptional. The place could use a few updates, while we were setting up, I went through the kitchen and it was spotless. I would actually have another event there. Thank you.Villa russo is one of the most elegant and classy places I have ever been to .this hall is amazing for all the best times in your life from your wedding..to a engagement party or to a sweet 16 birthday party or for a family reunion.or a baby shower. The decorations and statues make for an amazing backdrop. For all these great events in your life.this place give you a vibe of being in a luxurious castle. I  have been here numerous times and each time I am here it still amazes me how beautiful this place is .And the ambiance was very nice and friendly..and the staff was great. They always treated me respectfully. When ever I was there on union busines. I have been to a lot of classic and classy halls and extravagant places in nyc.I have to put villa russo up there with the top with a few of the places I have been to in nyc.i would definitely go back in the future.I have been here numerous times for years.it is a very Beautiful hall .for all kinds of events. Such as weddings, birthdays, baby showers,graduations.i was here for union members meeting. And the staff was great and the setting was superb. From the statues and chandeliers ,and other arts..I attended a friend's birthday party at this venue and had a ball. The venue was absolutely beautiful along with the exceptional service.  I was very impressed with the decor and ambience inside.  Now my friend outdid herself with her personal touches to make her party an event to remember.  We ate and drank (open bar)like we were at a wedding.  The music had us dancing in our seat while we were eating and then on the dance floor.  Lol. Just as we were done eating the birthday cake. The side curtains opened to a huge dessert area,  uhm uhmm. There was fruit,   cake,  candy apples,  cotton candy,  baileys and kahlua like drinks. Wooo hoo. Yes I took a nice goody bag home.  I would definitely check this place out as an option for a special event..I was having a wedding here June 12th 2020 obviously because of COVID-19 it was cancelled. I told them numerous times I want to cancel and get a refund and they kept responding they were not open due to COVID. Understandable but now it's five months later, I don't get a response from anyone anymore and i still have yet to get my full refund like promised when I was agreeing to have my wedding here.I had my 22nd birthday party here and I was in the upstairs room. The food was soooooo good, we had buffet style so it was very good for me and my friends. Mr.Russo even showed up and he made sure I was taken care of. The staff is great. I highly recommend..My Mother and I threw a surprise 60th Birthday for my Father earlier this month and everything was amazing! Our friends and family are still talking about how beautiful it was and how much of a great time they had! My Father was BEYOND happy that night and it was well worth the big secret!The staff at Villa Russo were all amazing and extremely accommodating throughout the planning process. Thanks so much to Donna & Jennifer as they were readily available to answer any and all questions I had between myself and all the vendors I hired. They mad things so much easier for us! Most importantly, the food was excellent! I asked a good amount of people what they ate every single person had nothing but compliments! Our Maître D', Eric, was fantastic and on his A-game the whole night! I was basically hosting alone since my Mother had to occupy my Father so he was a huge help in running things smoothly behind the scenes. This was such a huge day of celebration for my family and I'm so happy we chose Villa Russo for my Father's special day. Thanks!!!.We just attended a co-ed bridal shower over the weekend at this venue. The layout is pretty spacious with various rooms ranging from upstairs to a smaller area downstairs. There were several events held that day. My BFF's bridal shower was held in the party room, a medieval tower room. The venue decor is vintage Italian.The attendants were attentive and cater to every requests for food/drinks. Service was definitely top notch! For the bridal luncheon, a 3-course menu featured a choice of entree of either the eggplant tower, chicken francaise or salmon w/ lemon butter sauce. The first course was a cold antipasto & cheese platter with salami, fresh mozzarella, sharp cheddar, prosciutto, olives, peppers, and an individual pasta dish. Dessert was coffee and cake- strawberry w/ custard filling. Overall, the food was good in addition to the drinks-sangria/mimosa. The only negative factor is the location of the restroom. Although, there was a doorway gate that led to the restrooms downstairs, the filter did a poor job. The odor was definitely noticeable coming up the stairway. Not sure about the rest of the banquet hall but the party room had a slight musky smell. This is most likely due to where the restrooms are located. Def not a deal breaker. The restroom is clean..When I first found this place online, I fell in love. I didn't want any other place for our wedding. Therefore I was sooo happy that they fit into our budget nicely. I dealt with a few different staff members there, either by phone and in person, and they were all very nice and helpful.Our wedding day went smoothly because of the staff that day. We did both the ceremony and reception and the venue looked amazing. The food was awesome. Many people have told me since then just how good the food was and I also know since we made sure to eat from every course that was served.I am soo happy how everything turned out with them that I would definitely use them again for an event in the future. Thanks Villa Russo for our memorable wedding day!.Had our wedding here on August 25th and it exceeded our expectations by a landslide. Everything was perfect from the setup, to the amazing maitre'd Kim, the food; it truly made the happiest day of my life memorable. The owner George even came to us making sure everything was great. The planning process was also so smooth with Donna who is amazing!! I can't even think of one thing to nitpick about, I heavily recommend Villa Russo for your next event."
"Favorite local spot. Great people both staff and customers and even greater prices ($4 PBR/Modelo all day everyday or $6 for beer&shot combo). Extremely diverse crowd which represents Astoria well. Great pool table. Sometimes they have live music. Karaoke on Saturday nights is done well. They are very consistent with their buybacks which is refreshing. There's also a whole separate room that people rent out for parties.And the fact that they have a little back patio with ample benches and tables to smoke/drink/hang out.Dont whine about it being cash only..a irish bar on broadway in astoria thats not fancy , not loud. not filled with morons and a chill place to watch the game and relax. came in with my buddy to watch the nets game and i aint a booze drinker but one bud light and a bunch of diet cokes while sitting at a long wooden bar with a bunch of tvs all around will work just fine. no food but bring your own is ok , outdoor back patio is empty cause its cold and rainy but better weather is coming soon . a pool table and dart board if sports tv watching is not your thing . i like this place as the casual vibe is the complete opposite of the loud douchey dives i avoid and the drinks are priced right , bartenders are friendly and crowd is civil . 4 stars on my yelp meter..I have been here quite a few times. This place is only a few blocks from where I live.Ive come here on Sundays when Marty and the G-Men are performing who are awesome alsoEveryone is friendly here, its a nice atomosphere.Ive also been here many times for parties, which they have a decent size party room in the back. You do have to bring or cater your own food for the parties but that's OKGreat place, great people!!!.Great little divey sports bar just off the Broadway subway station. Cheap happy hour deals 11am-6pm every day. Little patio out the back where you can bring your drink and enjoy the sun. Perfect for a cold beer after work..If it wasn't by the train it wouldn't have lasted 6 months.  My friend got cash stolen from her bag and they wouldn't even look at the take. If you need a shithole on this intersection, go to gilby's.The bartender (Joe) is kind of rude. By which I mean the last time I went he brought up the one time I was sloppy. I've been there many times but he felt he needed to bring up the one scenario which was sure to embarrass me. In the same breath he asked about my pretty friend (who wasn't even there with me) that we'd previously told him was in a Years long relationship. Honestly, have some class man. Or at least some tact!.I feel betrayed by the owner, John. I had come here many times and my friend was a regular. We often brought friends, and last Saturday was no exception. We brought 4 more patrons, our friends, to this bar. We all smoked in the backyard. I was mildly tipsy, which is expected when going to a bar. Afterwards, we came indoors. I forgot my purse on the bench in the backyard RIGHT IN FRONT of the security camera, which never happened to me before in any bar. By the time I went to get it, my purse was gone and I found it in the open 'kitchenette' area near back exit. Immediately I discovered that someone stole all my cash (over $150). When I called the next morning, a female employee apathetically suggested that they don't check tapes for such things. I understand that they're ""not responsible for lost or stolen property"".  That's a standard policy.  But are they responsible for giving a damn about customers that bring them business? I bet that if someone stole the bar's property, they'd check the tapes in a heartbeat. My friend, who lives in the area, spoke to John today on my behalf. He said he didn't even bother looking at the tape and said he'll only give it to police (as if the cops would give a damn about $150).  Yes, I made a mistake in forgetting my purse. That's on me. But considering how much business my friend and I have brought to McLoughlin Astoria Bar over the years, we thought that John would AT LEAST TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT THE TAPE because there are some shady people coming to that bar and customers' safety is not his priority. That means that whoever stole my money is probably going to come back and steal more from someone else in a vulnerable moment and John can't be bothered to learn who it was, for safety of his customers and their belongings. I get why he would not want to show me the tapes, but it's the absence of caring that bothered us most. John could have said: ""Hey, I looked at the tapes. I saw who did it. I can't show it to you, but please let's contact the cops because this sh*t will not fly at my bar and I want people to know that.""  My friend and I will never come there again.  If something worse were to ever happen to us there, nobody would give a damn..Like the Broadway and Irish gilley's bar close by an oasis of lives yet to live. Filled with classless hacks and desperate souls. At least here you can be you without reproach. Drinks are cheap and it's open late, if you keep quiet you can have a good time and meet new people. Compared to the places close by, 8t is your best bet!.Great local haunt. No frills or faux-hipster chic attitudes...leave those at the door... but a good pool table, quaint outdoor patio space, cheap drinks, a fine Guinness pour.  the crowd ranges from blue collar to old neighborhood locals to after hours to people just getting off the subway.  Joanne is the absolute nicest barkeep in town..Seriously an hidden gem. I've been passing this bar for 10+ years. So, on a random Saturday night I met a bunch of friends here. First off you would never think that this place is big on the inside. The bar is right there as soon as you walk in. There is a pool table would a generous amount of space to play. The darts area is separated  by a pillar. If you walk even more towards the back there is an outside patio area. I really am impressed with this bar.:::BATHROOM ALERT:::I didn't think the bathrooms were going to be much to speak about but they are. There are two stalls and a mini sink. If people needed to wait to pee a total of 5 people could fit if there is one person in each of the stalls. The bathroom was clean, toliet paper stocked well, sink was clean and the soap was well stocked. No complaints there. The drink prices were really cheap. The bartender was actually really sweet. I felt bad for him because some drunk guy kept throwing coats around and he had to leave the bar for 15mins to get the man out. So, the four out of 5 stars is because there should have been someone else working. I am sure this will be the only time I see this at this spot and review it again when I got a second time. For you music lovers there is a jukebox."

"ok so i live in the upper 120's.  101 deli is over 20 blocks to walk.  If my feet and legs fell off tomorrow i would drag my body all that way to get an egg sandwich at 101 deli!!  This is by far the best deli on the Rock!!You walk in, the counter is to your right.  Remember to bring cash, no cards.  Friendly help, even the patrons were all cool standing and waiting.  the sandwich was two eggs bacon and cheese on a roll.  simple enough?  oh no people, by far the most delicious sandwich on the beach!  loaded with bacon, cheese melted and dripping down my hand.  the roll nice and soft but toasted to perfection!!  i lost 2 pounds walking there and back but gained 4 eating the monster of a sandwich!!  Thanks 101!!!  you cant go wrong here!!.Every deli salad you could possibly imagine. 6 different types of potato salad, 8 different types of pasta salad. So many grilled, roasted, marinated veggie salads. I had the grilled veggie sandwich on a hero: roasted assorted veggies, roasted red peppers, and bruschetta -- it usually comes with mozzarella but I asked for it without to make it vegan, except I forgot to ask if the bruschetta had Parmesan in it (I think it does). Either way it was delicious and enormous. The bread was great, soft, sesame hero. The veggies were juicy and so garlicky. And it was fast and made with love..Yikes. The women who work at the counter wear their masks around their chin. Always. They are crass when you ask them to put them on. Rockaway has a decent positive rate. Maybe be a little cleaner in a pandemic when you work with lunch meat?The bread I received on my sandwich reminded me of an airport sandwich..I have to admit, 101 Deli was certainly extremely good. They have so many selections and prices are great. Everything was fresh and tasted very good. Service was amazing and every one working here was extremely nice and hospitable. 101 Deli....The place is really cool..This place is great! The staff is incredible friendly and caring. The food is delicious and fresh, it's a great spot to get a sandwich. Highly recommend bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich! It's awesome!.What can I say about this one time landmark business. It's best days are at least Thirty years in the past . The counter staff looks like they are on parole from rehab. There's that weird shiny glaze on everything in the deli cases just like the left out all day macaroni salad at a family picnic . The sandwiches just aren't good anymore. It's sad they sell too many things and they don't move oxidizing in the case . I wish they would concentrate on making a better sandwich a good potato salad a cole slaw that's not sitting in the bucket of milky Mayo water and a Mac and tuna salad. Get your act together.Went there and ordered a #1 which was supposed to be Chicken Cutlet on a hero with fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers.  What I got was a dry piece of chicken cutlet slapped onto bread with nothing.  No fresh mozzarella and no roasted peppers. As if that wasn't bad enough, it took forever to make even though the store was practically empty.  That and a tea costed almost $14.  Needless to say, I won't be going back..Always love going here! Can't recommend enough! Staff is friendly and courteous. Always greet me by name. I get coffee here every morning, while on way to work. And salads usually..Listen - I don't do this, even when things are bad, but this place was just so awful that I HAVE to write this review. After waiting 45 minutes for two sandwiches, one of the six people taking orders and running around like chickens with their heads cut off noticed we'd been waiting for a while. She went to find our food and realized the kitchen didn't have a ticket for our order. Somehow, it got lost in the 6 feet between the counter and the sandwich slicers. Maybe it was because their ordering system is from the Stone Age. Maybe it was because people making sandwiches don't have a care in the world - we saw multiple sandwiches come up for other people who had already walked out. Maybe it was because there were so many employees that some just walked in a circle because there was nothing for them to do. It was a circus. I've worked in food service for over a decade - I've never seen anything like it. I'm honestly at a loss for words for what I witnessed there. I wanted a roast beef sandwich. Now I just want my time back..This deli has the best sandwiches in the rockaways hands down. I have gotten the chicken parm hero, the Thursday special (hot roast beef mozz cheese and gravy), and a chicken cutlet hero and they are all so delicious. The secret here is the bread. Their fresh baked rolls are insane. Any sandwich here is elevated because the bread is so good. I tried the cookies in the display case and they weren't anything I would try again. The cookie tasted a little stale and it did not represent the quality of their products. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sandwich in the rockaways.***To Avoid a wait call in advance and simply pick up your order - it will save you a headache******* CASH ONLY*****  They do have an ATM on site"
"Love this place. Really hidden away and far up the avenue, but if you're looking for a quiet drink spot or a nightcap, this might be the place for you.Friendly bartender, straight forward drinks, decent beer/wine list. If you're in the area and looking to pass by some time, can't go wrong..I've been meaning to come here for years and was so glad to have visited this past weekend. Came around 4pm on a Saturday and there was plenty of room to grab a seat. They have a good beer and wine selection and while the cocktail menu is short, it's very good! The bartender was also very friendly and accommodating. Yes, this place is dark, but not THAT dark. Definitely great for a date. Pro tip - bench seats on the side are cocktail table height so be prepared to do a little jumping if you are below the height of 5'7""!.NOT A SAFE BAR FOR WOMENThis is really creepy. A close friend was there last weekend on a Bumble date and she noticed her drink tasted off and there was something like an undissolved pill in the bottom of her drink. She convinced her date roofied her with assistance from the bartender. Fortunately she noticed and she's okay. Be careful at this bar..Place is great - staff is nice, cool ambiance. It's a bit dark but wouldn't consider that a big deal. Would definitely recommend and go back again!.I'm from Oakland CA and I absolutely love visiting NY but I am not a huge fan of all the touristy spots. The Other room checks all the right vibe boxes. I don't know what it's like during the day but at night it feels like a secret. It's dark and candle lit with a friendly but somewhat moody bartender who has a killer play list. (That Anderson Paak had me wanting to stay all night) Everything I love about a perfect NY bar. Made me feel like I was gaining cool points just being in there. My old fashioned was on point. I'll be back..A friend recommended we come here. It's not a dive bar but it's not a fancy cocktail bar. It's somewhere in between, which was perfect for what we were looking for. Their drink selection is somewhat modest, but it didn't bother us at all. The ambiance is very chill and low-key. This would be a perfect date night spot!.A comfortable, classy speakeasy that's nice to relax in over a few drinks..Love this little gem in the west village! This place was built for dates (cozy seating, candle light, fun music). It is mainly a beer and wine bar with limited cocktail options. On quiet nights the bartenders would also make custom cocktails based on your preferences, which was fun!Pre-COVID, I loved coming to the other room for drinks and wandering around the west village afterwards - it doesn't get more romantic than that. They have since built outdoor seating and it was nice in summer but I can't comment on their winter set up..I've been here three times, and two out of the three it was because every other bar in this area was packed. Don't get me wrong: this isn't a last resort type of place. Far from it -- literally, it's kind of far to get to from the main thoroughfare of the West Village. It might look like it's packed on the outside (especially on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday evening), but usually you can find seats inside. The place has an interesting set up. There's a sleek leather booth running along one entire wall with three tables. These are probably the prime seats in the house, so to speak. The space is bigger than it looks on the outside, but you can tell they're not trying to maximize real estate to cram more people in. They are really all about creating that intimate vibe. Great date place. Drinks are on the pricey side. Cocktails run from $15-18 last time I checked, but they are a better deal, in my opinion, than wine. For a couple of bucks more you get a really delicious concoction that is STRONG. Have gotten the Negroni and the Old-Fashioned. Both are excellent. You can nurse one drink all night and feel very good walking out..Dark, romantic spot that's good for a date. I did not come with a date, I came with a friend because we were both early for dinner and wanted to get drinks. It was fine, except I felt like everyone could hear our conversation. It was very early though.I can see this place being ridiculously happening later at night. Overall, I enjoyed it and I definitely would recommend it to my friends."
"Quick , not expensive take out place for fried fish. This place is very popular usually a line outside . the fried Bass with Mashed potatoes are very filling & delicious! Once you get in you gotta yell your order to the guys because thats the way the other customers do it . If you stand there you will be there all day . The ""7 powers"" soup is a good hangover cure its like a mix seafood soup but at 6$ for a small , I doubt there is any REAL seafood in there . Still good tho.El Tina Fish Market; during better times (pre COVID-19), it was the 24/7 seafood spot that everyone went to when coming out of their sister bar/lounge to satisfy their drunchies. Other patrons swear that the food is equally as amazing whether you're drunk or sober. The good news is it's conveniently located right under the 207th street stop on the 1 train. Bring cash as they do not accept credit cards. Their fried fish combo with mashed potatoes and tostones is probably the best combo you'll find on their menu. They pack it nicely into a paper box and you can feel its warmth all throughout your walk/train ride/Uber ride. The fish tastes amazingly fresh, their potatoes will comfort you on the even the worst days, and the tostones vary between crunchy and soft to appease all tastes. You give the man at the counter 12 dollars, and he slides you a heavy box filled with protein and carbs that most people cannot finish in one sitting. If you are looking for something on the lighter side, their sopa pescado is also one for the books. Throw some lime and hot sauce in that bad boy and it's perfection. I rarely go 3 stops out of my way for food, but El Tina was worth the literal extra mile..The best fried shrimp and mashed potatoes with extra onions! This place is legit the best for fried shrimp.  The shrimp is not fried too hard and its very fresh!  Just see the photos! Worth a stop in if in the area.  Will definitely try the seafood soup next time!.I love this place I've only been here after dark when the restaurant dine in part closes but everything is great. My boyfriend loves the whiting sandwiches with fries and I love the soup, the fried plantains, the fried shrimp and the pickled onions especially the mashed potato & the seafood salad. Everything is fresh & great everytime! The regulars are kind of pushy there so they can smell new blood, definitely stand your ground and wait in line and the wait will be worth it..I give it a 4 because although i know these guys are busy and tired they dont have to be unpleasant and unwelcoming. I honestly just be wanting to get my food and leave. I only get their fried shrimps and totones when i go and it always hit..This place has been open for quite some time now. The thing I like is that it's always consistent and fresh. They have some really good fried fish and shrimp!! The seafood here is delicious and there's no argument about that. This is really quality over quantity because it does feel like it's a little bit of food but when you think about it even places like city island charge about the same prices. For fried shrimp for 5 shrimps with fries  it's about 7$ & for 10 shrimps is about 13$. I would definitely keep coming here the food is good and they're open 24 hours.If you get hungry at late night and you're around 207th street you know where to go..I've heard many great things so we ordered the fried fish, shrimp and mashed potatoes. Good portion size but no flavor..Fresh whitey ( fish is actually better) and shrimp fish open 24 hrs .. mash potatoes  are bomb !!.Was hanging out in Inwood and we saw this place and had to come inside. The smell of their fried fish was intoxicating and we went for their small cerviche and fried fish with green plantain, which was filling enough for two to share. The restaurant is small, almost like a railroad style with stools on the side of the bar tables and about 3 tables on the side for those who come in fours. Personally, I recommend the bar area so you can watch them make their yummy fish. Their fish and cerviche was very fresh and flavored very well. Their service is excellent and this place was really packed on a Saturday around 4pm when we where there. If you're around the area, you gotta check this place out. Oooh and one more thing, their soup is AMAZING!, a medley of seafood that's seasoned very well and is definitely perfect for the winter months (or just any months if you're into seafood itself)!!!.This is the best fish spot I've been to ever! I love that the fish never smells fishy if that makes any sense everything is always fresh and it always taste the same no matter how many times you go there you get the same quality every time. They're also open 24 hours so you can't beat that. This place gets really busy on the weekends after a good night of clubbing. I love their shrimp and fish and octopus salad is definitely a must"
"Fantastic slice of pepperoni pizza, great blend of cheese, and lots of flavor. Super friendly staff!"
"It's a Dunkin Donuts. The boyfriend and I enjoyed our Oreo Coolattas here (he had their frozen Oreo coffee and I went with their frozen Oreo Vanilla Bean variety). They were both good, was my first Oreo one but I've done their plain Vanilla one and this one was definitely better - very sweet but not sickening so. Muffins here looked especially good and they had a variety of fresh looking doughnuts and bagels.This location was very clean, the staff was friendly we had a pleasant sit-down experience here :)..Lmfao I'm done with this location beyond negative star needed. Huge health code violation!If you have a foot fetish & love donuts and coffee. This is you're go too place!.Horrible!! One day I ordered a Chicken salad wrap when they just came out with it. I said hell I shall give it a shot!!until then I realized that it had bacon in it... WHICH IS SOMETHING I CANNOT EAT!!because of religious purposes...I apologize to the employee, and told her I cannot have bacon.. with a nasty attitude and said it is to late. I look at her and told her I am sorry but I am Muslim and you are to as well so you and I know we cannot eat bacon.. I told her I need a new one with out any bacon substance touching it.. I was polite to her as well but she gotten mad just because she had to re make a order..now Next time I went there I went and order a vanilla Chi drink... Instead of getting fresh milk to steam they used the one that was already sitting in that cup and steamed it.. My drink tasted nasty!! and was filled with nothing butyl HOT milk.. that's it..My god I tired giving them another chance but that's that... Not getting my business again! not until the employees have better services!!.i was in astoria on a sunday morning on steinway and the craving for a sesame bagel, hash browns and a cold ice coffee hit me like  a ton of cotton balls. its order and go which is ok cause they like you sit while you wait and the free wifi is still up and running . even with the current situation this particular  dd has the full menu offering including the donuts and muffins , etc. follow the six feet apart rule or the gal behind the counter will read you the riot act and thats fine with me. got my order which was filled correctly and the cold coffee drink was made extra sweet which hides the coffee after taste . not many dunkin donuts are open in the nyc area so finding one open is a welcome sight . just remember to grab your food and drink and bounce or big mama behind the counter will lay down the rules very loudly as she should..Service always depends on the staff. Tonight they were friendly, fast and I ordered an iced coffee and donut in minutes. Still a passable experience and above their usual quality..My first one-star review, after 35 previous reviews.  Here's why:Me: Hi.  The, #6 - can you substitute out the coffee for a latte?Worker: No.Me: Ok, then let me get a #6, just the sandwich (an egg white wrap) and a small vanilla latte light...Worker: Two #6s (punches in two)Me: No, I just want one #6.Worker: (Stares at me and smiles) Then why did you say ""two?""Me: I never said ""two.""Worker: (shakes head)  Anything else?Me: No.I actually was going to order something else, but decided to take my order elsewhere.  My friend waited for her order (the one I had put in originally) and when I met up with her afterward, she said the second worker in the back was also acting weird and mumbling under her breath and looking at my friend.  She felt like the two workers were talking about us, but they were speaking in another language so she couldn't be sure.Is it so hard to provide courteous service and not make the customers feel like they are intruders in your space?  I guess in this DD, it is too hard.  Or did I say ""two"" hard?  Doesn't matter, I'm never going back here..Bad service....because I sat down they skipped me on my order. When I made them aware of it they still made two more sandwiches before making mine. They then told me the machines aren't working well!?!.I could write that this Dunkin Donuts is just like any other (which is what most people do when it comes to chains) However, the problem is I've only ever been in 3 Dunkin Donuts, and I first set foot in one only about 2 years ago.I guess for frozen reheated donuts they aren't that bad, but then again I've only had 2 ever.  I guess their hot chocolate is good, but I've only had it about 2 times, and I guess their iced coffee isn't bad since that's pretty much the most I've ever had their. The staff always seems friendly and there is always one person cleaning so I guess it's pretty clean, and I guess that's all I can say about that..I'm not much of a coffee guy, but I know when it tastes terrible. This morning, Planet Fitness offered complimentary coffee from this Dunkin Donuts, and it tasted like burnt water with a hint of bitter flavoring.The free bagel was the the typical mediocre doughy jumble you'd find in a supermarket. It was at least edible.The store itself is acceptable, but not worth visiting for any reason..This is my first yelp review and it sadly is a one star review. I generally don't complain when my order gets messed up because mistakes happen. However this store has never once given me what I ordered. This store is never busy, which should have been my first red flag, and the service is terrible. They aren't making mistakes, they are simply not listening to what the customer is asking for. They are never happy or polite and just take zero pride in their business. I honestly don't think I can give them any more chances it's the most disappointing dunkin I've ever been in..I've decided to rewrite my entire review for this location. After having a few less than stellar visits, I had given it a poor review. Since then I have been back, and the service has been pretty great. The people got to know me, anticipated my order with stunning accuracy, and are always very friendly."
"Not memorable but it suited me when I was craving pizza.A bit greasy on the tummy but they do have some fun flavors you can get by the slice; which is always nice.Thinner pizza but still saucey and moderately priced.I wouldn't make the special trip out there but I would t be upset if I had to eat it again.3/5.Now Chiara's Pizzeria, I guess things under new management is only making things worse. Danny's or Chiara should be embarrassed and lost a customer today after charging $18.50 for ""Chicken Francese"". Enough is enough. You cannot send someone this meal for delivery because I cannot tell you in person how awful this was. First, how could you serve this with LIMES?! Are you out of lemons? No excuse. Second, is this grilled chicken, with a bunch of seasoning, like that on a Ceaser salad? Guess we are not breading things either more too. Third, those are the sadest, toughest pieces of chicken ever. Period. Some items are good there, but playing roulette over an Italian staple and getting this, not worth it. There are far too many places to eat this ever again..I usually order from this place and have never minded the things that might otherwise deter people from ordering. Sure, they're often 15 minutes late, or their delivery guy refuses to come up the stairs or even to the front door of my building (especially in bad weather which is kind of why I'm ordering delivery), or that they will occasionally forget a soda or something small, but hey, stuff happens. However, my most recent order was delivered to the wrong apartment. When I called to check-in on my missing food, whoever answered the phone was incredibly rude, told me that my order was delivered to a woman, and that there was nothing they could do for me. I reiterated that nobody had rang the bell and I did not have any food, even going downstairs to ensure that it wasn't left at my door if I had missed the bell. ""What do you want me to do? We delivered your food."" was essentially the only response they could give me, even refusing a refund..ORDERED DELIVERY:I would give this place 0 stars if it was possible. I ordered from here two weekends ago. I was given an estimate of 30-40 minutes from Seamless and once I had ordered it had gone up to 45 - 55 minute wait. Fine, I'll wait. However, once an hour and twenty minutes had passed I decided to call. They told me ten minutes. Twenty minutes goes by and their delivery guy calls me to say he's there. I go outside, and he is not there. I ask where he is, he's completely at the wrong address. I tell him where to go. He calls back, says he's here, he's not. This goes on about 5 more times. He also tells me he's on my street when he's not and asks me to WALK to him, when he's half a block up and Im just in slippers running in and out thinking he's there. He's on his cell phone and could have looked it up or called his restaurant as I had a very difficult time understanding him and he knew it. He didn't' bother to try and help by any means. I even called his store to try to get them to help and they kept assuring me they had found him and he was coming. None the less my roommate ended up walking a block to go meet him and my pizza had been out for delivery for at least 30 minutes that Im aware he drove around not being at my house. It was cold, the cheese had already begun to change colors, and it was the worst delivery service I've ever had in my life. Oh and no they didn't ever call to apologize or try to gain a customer back. Extremely recommend against this place. Unless you like to wait over 2 hours for cold and bad pizza..Cockroach on pizza. Delivery guy won't deliver. Awful place. Read the reviews. There is a reason there are more awful reviews than good reviews..So, Chiara's doesn't have the best pizza. It's ok, not great. BUT while I was waiting for a mediocre sandwich to be reheated one of employees (possibly a relative) started acting very aggressively to the woman who owns the pizzeria. They went into the back and everyone in the pizzeria heard a scuffle and someone hitting someone else. Judging by how aggressively the man was acting to the owner I'm guessing he hit her. NONE of the other men in the restaurant thought maybe they should go into the back and see if she was ok, or tell the man to tone it the ""F"" down.I am appalled and I'm never eating here again..This is the best Pizza spot in this Area and has been around the longest. Their stuff shells is to die for!!  and the prices are decent.  Don't hesitate to order the garlic knots. They run out constantly!!.Had food catered and it was delicious. The chicken parm, hot wings and meatballs were awesome..I really feel like people sleep on this place's pizza. My go-to is usually the regular slice and it's GOOD.I only get to have the crust from my parents but from what I can smell, yum! heh..I hit dannys up for some buffalo wings on superbowl 49 (patriots vs seahawks)I must say there were pretty good, nice & chewy! The blue cheese was a great match with it. Bought a slice before too, was good, could be bigger. I definatley prefer the wings over The slice..But i ll be back"
"We were in the area and found this restaurant to have the highest number of positive reviews so we stopped in.  It is a smaller pizza shop with very limited seating available, it appears most people order take out here.  We were fortunate enough to have a table open up while we were waiting.  They do not accept credit so make sure you have cash, there is an atm located in the business next door.  I ordered a few slices of the Sicilian style cheese pizza, they have a very large menu with a wide variety of options, other than pizza.  The pizza was very fresh, it also appeared they use fresh mozzarella cheese rather than the processed cheese.  The pizza was very good, especially for the price.  Cheers!.So last week I went into this pizza shop and ordered a slice and beef patty with cheese.  Was on my way to grind and was ahead of schedule so I wasn't rushing.   Ordered and stepped back to take in the scenery.  Observed an employee or boss making a fresh pie. Mind you he just finished taking an order on the cordless phone.  Oh no he didn't wash his hands.  Ok. First strike for me.  So he is flipping the dough in the air which I haven't seen in quite sometime....  Strike two hits me like a ROCK.  Dude had the crazy hairy fore arms and the dough is constantly rubbing against his hairs.  Who wants to see dough you are about to make into pizza coming in contact with your hairs!?!  You can't control those hairs staying on your arms. I was done‼‼‼ no need to get your 3rd strike.  You are out‼‼‼ but wait... On my way out someone pays for their order and he takes the $20 bill and gives the customer change and he is right back to making that pizza.   I KNOW that you as a business owner is very much aware that money is dirty and when you handle it YOU ARE REQUIRED to wash your hands and or use gloves.  I say boycott this place unless you are looking to use sick leave at your job.  Tried to get a pic of dude but seemed to get smart as my facial expressions were looking at him like he was insane‼‼‼ never returning to this spot and this has tauhgt me to monitor these pizza joints before I order..I lived in this area for 30 years. And that's how long mayb older this pizza joint is. It's a family place.  Many that go there know each other from around the neighborhood. Friendly place. But let's talk about food. It's the bomb! Baked ziti is top knoch.huge orsee u can split into four . Well for me lol. I can't eat it all in one sit. That's how big order is. Pizza slices are good best around.  And the best of all the prices are good. Wont break ur pocket.  This place is a must try.Low cost but high quality. Last time you could get a slice like this for only a $1.50, Bill Clinton was President. Really good pizza in a no frills shop..A decent slice of pizza for $1.50. The taste is average but tasty for the price. They have a special for two slices and a can of soda for $3.50. The staff was friendly and they had a dedicated cashier..This is the best f*cking pizza we have ever eaten anywhere!!! We made it a point to return to this pizzeria on our most recent trip to NY from NC.  It can only be described as FINGER LICKING GOOD!!  It is a must try for those that are traveling here to visit or just passing through.  I am originally from Brooklyn and while there are many pizzerias to choose from, this one is in my top 3.  Even my 3 yr old daughter was licking her little fingers..I love their food especially the meatball sandwich and the pizza they make their food freshly prepared and costumer service very nice and helpful I been going their for years the Best food you can ask for.This pizza isn't the best I've had but I will say this- it's always fresh. No wonder! It's conveniently located about 2 blocks from a pool and accessible by a few MTA buses. What they lack in size they make up for in loyalty to their customers. They make you feel welcome. The zeppoles are ok. Enjoy!.I know this pizzeria well and the food can be decribed in one word, comfort. One good thing about this place is the portion sizes so at least you know you will never go hungry. I would have to say the only minus is the wait time to get your food but that's a small thing considering what your getting..This is the best pizza joint in the Bronx...I go out of my way to grab lunch here on a regular basis.  Pizza and meals are always delicious, great portions and inexpensive."
"My son had a blast with his friends and family to celebrate a couple of days early, his 5th Birthday! Party started at 11AM which turned out perfect because the place didn't crowd out into Chucky Cheese loco mode until after 1230 1PM. Plenty to do for the kids and the party rooms are a good size for cake time and photos. PLEASE NOTE: ALL CASH AFFAIR... If you are planning a party reservation for your little one make sure to bring the green. Overall, Parents seemed happy and enjoyed their pizza, and kids their tokens and Birthday cake. Nice to see all the kids run around happy in a Sunday Birthday indoor fun zone in Brooklyn. Wife and Birthday Boy happy means Two Thumbs Up.Our first option of an indoor playhouse was holding a private party. So we drove 5 min to arrive here. Now I didn't know what to expect but this place could use a good cleaning. The floor was filthy. Food was spilled over and tons of trash bags all over the place. My 2yo absolutely enjoyed himself because he's not worried about the things we are. More than enough space to feel socially distanced but no one wears a mask here neither it's enforced. Just take all this into consideration before giving this place a shot. It has very appealing arcade games and a decent ball pit. Like I said, kids will enjoy it. It would absolutely be better with more consistent upkeep..Don't recommends this place at all. HUGE RIP OFF. They give there people preference. They don't allow outside food or cake which is pointless of renting the place out for only 2 hours for a birthday party. Games are not included and you have to pay for it. Owner is very rude and unprofessional. Only one staff member was very polite. Wouldn't recommend this place at all for a birthday party. Don't waste your money huge rip off. Would never come back to this place. There is better playgrounds out there for children with birthday packages..I had a great time.My only concern is That a lot of people that work there don't wear the mask correctly. And some people don't even. Wear it. Is a safety concern.This place is so dirty! It's a Petri dish of diseases. I am surprised there are not more kids getting sick from playing here. I saw kids wiping their runny noses on the walls, chairs, play areas. There is not enough staff to monitor and clean up the messes. The bathrooms are filthy. There was overflowing trash, dirty diapers on the floor because the parents just couldn't put it in the trash?!! The parents who come here are also not very attentive. I saw a lot of unsupervised kids running around, without any adults watching them at all. I know it's a play space, but when the kids are falling all over each other, wiping snots on the floor and play space, their parents or staff should clean it up ASAP. I would never come here again. I could not wait to get home and put my kids in a bath after attending a birthday party here..Thought I previously reviewed this place when I came for my second, and final time back in 2014. I was here as a teenager for my cousins birthday, which was quite some ago. I returned when I saw a Groupon; we brought our daughter here and the place was basically a disaster.The place looks very run down, outdated, and just not a place you want to take your child. Basically, if you're in Brooklyn, and have absolutely nowhere else to go and need a place to go but don't want to spend much money, come here. However, if you're looking for a pleasurable place that looks sanitary, has working equipment and want decent food, this isn't your place.I really wish I could say something positive about this place because when I came as a teenager, I had fun; but things have changed for the worst!.We had my daughter's birthday party there, and didn't like the place at all. The party room was very cold. It has not been heated until I asked, when everybody was cold already. The kids are playing in socks, and the floor in the rooms is tile covered and really cold. The facilities are very old, torn and dusty. I ordered extra baloons for the room decoration. I called in advance and asked the purple and violet ballons for decoration. The ballons were brought at the end of the party when the half of the guests took off already and the ballons were very small, cheap and different colors with ANY purple one! I ordered a large pot of tea, and it was hardly warm, with unboiled water and had only one tea bag for a large pot. I ordered also a dozen of spinach bourekas, all were   burned and nobody ate it. I asked to take it back and not charge it, but the owner told that 4 of a dozen were missing (of course, it was in a trash bin!) and charged a half price for it. And at last, the ice cream cake for my daughter had a mistake in a word BIRTHDAY! Guys, you get money for every piece of s.. there, so please make it work!.I had a party package for this place for my sons 3rd birthday. I was pleased with most everything except for the suggested tip for the workers that bring in the cake and the pizza for the kids. I provided a tip at the end, but I could tell the workers were dissatisfied and it affected their demeanor for the rest of the night, which I felt was unprofessional. Over all I appreciated the diversity. It was nice to see children of all shades and religious background, playing together and around one another. The loudspeaker is a little unclear so i think some tweaking to that system would be helpful especially for large parties. I plan on returning in the future because the children had a fantastic time..If there was an option for 0 stars I would give it. This place is filthy. Went with my students and we all got strep the day after. Thought it was a coincidence so we went back on another trip and 3 of us got a stomach virus. Stay away!!!!.My favorite part of Dante's ""Inferno"" is when he unwittingly stumbles into Kids N Action before he reaches the 9th Circle of Hell. OK, well, if Dante had lived in present-day Brooklyn, he would have included this creepy, dangerous, and filthy cash-grab.My sons wanted to go to CHUCK-E-CHEESE in Atlantic Center, but it was insanely crowded, so we agreed to go to the more local Kids N Action. What a disappointment.The young lady who took our money was unfriendly. Each ticket (including rides and admission) ran about $18. I understand that they have the occasional Groupon deal. We walked in, and barely made it out.The rides are unsafe looking, and on things like the ""roller coast"", carts were actually off-limits because of damage-- but the coaster still ran. Awful little gremlin-looking kids cut my kids, but finally they got on. The shit was dangerous looking, but my kids hung on for dear life and survived. The other ride was a train. I think the KNA folks built it themselves.GAMES: Many of the games were damaged and out of service. Many resembled casino-style games, which was troubling.THE CENTRAL ""PLAY AREA""/""MAZE"": Do you remember the film ""HELLRAISER""? The head demon shoots out rusty hooked chains all over, like a deadly spider web, and traps and tortures his victims. This was similar. Completely unsafe and UNMONITORED! My youngest kid got trapped in the ropes, and NO ONE helped him. I had to climb my sorry ass into the maze to rescue him. PARENTS: There were some great parents here. There were some awful parents-- they stay there in the food area, sucking up the oxygen while their poppets ran amok. I'm not Dad of the Year, but I like to make sure my kids are ok. I suppose the parents are sad because this is where they are... ABANDON HOPE ALL WHO ENTER.STAFF: What a bunch of inept clowns. It's not about kids having fun, or safety-- it's about money. They weren't polite. They weren't caring... just parsimonious. Even when cashing in tickets for prizes, they exhibited stinginess and counted to the exact ticket before handing out their cheap-as-fuck prizes. I was sickened. HOWEVER... there was this one woman who was sooo nice. She ran the train.. the one the KNA staff built. She kept slipping my kids tokens. God bless you, ma'am. Your heart is full of love, even in this circle of Hell.DECOR: A little like the antagonist's basement at the end of Silence of the Lambs. The walls are painted with likenesses of famous characters, like Ernie or Donald Duck, but they look ""off""-- sort of sinister and crude-- can you do that, just appropriate famous  characters and use them for your own nefarious purposes? Weird.CLEANLINESS/SAFETY: On a scale of 1-10, I would give them both a 2. Safety is a real concern here. Perhaps the main reason you should steer clear.MASCOT: Kids N Action's mascot is Bedbugs.OVERALL: This place is a shameful commentary on people. KNA is making money off kids. This is a problem because the management obviously doesn't really care much about the fun-factor. They don't maintain it and clean it. The first person you meet (the young blonde girl) was rude. One person who worked there was nice (she knew how dreadful the place was for sure). Fucking shameful. Kids are the most innocent and grandest people in the world, and Kids N Action is merely out to exploit them for $$$. Shut this place down.NEXT STEPS: I strongly recommend taking your kids to Sesame Place (pref. off-season). You can do it for fairly cheap, and there is educational fun to be had, and people who care about kids more than profiting off them."

"I love this neighbourhood pizza joint right in Rego Park - my bf and I's go to whenever we don't feel like cooking dinner.We usually order online for pick up and by the time we get there, it's already ready. We also ordered delivery a couple times and was pleased with the delivery time and how hot our food came.The beef patty is bomb and just the way I love it. Their pizza are rich with toppings and the cheese melts in your mouth with each bite. Mhmm Mhmm Mhmmm!.Decent pizza but slowwwwwwwwww delivery. Makes you want to call them and cancel but by then we've ready invested in waiting so long that we just wait the eternity for the pizza. That's why we don't order much from them anymore.Ordered delivery from here while I was in town visiting my brother and his family. Wanted a good NY style pizza, and this is what we got. With kids eating as well, we went simple with pepperoni and cheese. The slices are large, and the kind that you'll need to fold to get a proper bite. Quality of each slice was mouth watering, and the crust was good too. I'd order from J&D again in the future when I come back to visit..On August 7, 2021 the health department found ""Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas."" Ewww! The food is usually decent but this is difficult to digest..J & D pizza has been around 35 years and I'm surprised I haven't heard of it sooner! All the pizza was tasty and the pasta was amazing. Everything that I had was a solid 10/10The Sicilian was super fluffy which I loved and the grandma was perfect as was their plain slice! The chicken francese was cooked nicely and tasted awesome but the Star was that ziti a la vodka. It's hard to find a good vodka sauce in just any pizzeria but it was *chef's kiss*.Hello Yelpers,I frequently visit Queens and fins J&D's Pizza is my go to place for great dinners and pizza...  The owners, a father and son duo are kind, interactive, and genuinely dedicated to providing you and I a wonderful dining experience.. To the naysayers, I offer you this, if you have a problem with your food, experience, or any other aspect of J&D's how about contacting the owners like a respectful human being and working it out...  Being a keyboard warrior won't fix your experience...  (I am an outertowner who comes here often based on a friends suggestion and when I read some of the reviews I felt compelled to make this review...)This will continue to be my goto place for Pizza and Italian Grub....Ciao!.This pizzeria is absolutely disgusting soggy pizza. They have humongous portions but who cares when you get the worst quality pizza. I know others say they like it. I think it's them being respectful because forest hills had bad selections of pizza. Honestly avoid this place like the plague. Crap quality.I never used to like Sicilian pizza until I tried it from J&D Pizzeria! Crunchy bottom & crust, sweet thick sauce, & extra melty cheese. Great prices and excellent menu choices..Just OK. Too much dough, and not of great quality, not enough pepperoni. My daughter ordered from them by mistake, and I was not impressed. Same as several years back when I bought a pizza in person. This is the closest pizzeria to my home but I would rather order Domino's..Great Italian food and so much more! Check these guys out! They have everything and it's all great! The owner Joe is sooo cool and friendly! Great staff and amazing food... what are you waiting for? Check them out!"

"I was in here Sunday around 2:30.  I looked at rhe slices available and asked fir the margherita slice. It was promptly heated abd bagged up..The sauce was not too thick and there was enough basil. I think it could have used more cheese..Came here a few times with the kids so my daughter could get a beef patty cuz Joe's doesn't sell them.  Pizza is mediocre, garlic knots were inedible, staff is meh. The last time we went, i got upset with the guy because he was very dismissive to someone else because of how they looked. Gonna look for another pizzeria in the neighborhood the sells beef patties, and hopefully has better service and food..We were heading out of a show and popped in here for a slice. I must say.... this was some really good NYC pie. Their prices were really reasonable and the crust was nearly perfect. Their sauce was a little sweet but not too terribly sweet. Just the way I like it!.This is an under-rated classic in Greenwich village right on MacDougal.  We stopped in for a quick slice and were very happy.  The crust is thicker than Joe's but had a nice crispiness.  The sauce is flavorful and robust - not just salty, and the best part is that there is a VERY generous amount of mozzarella - the quality kind that gives that perfect string pull when it's hot.  It's $3.00 for a slice and one of the better values in the area.  Worth a visit!.Restaurant looks a little run down but of course these are the places with the best pizza. Nice crust & great sauce. Fairly priced at 4 dollars a slice. Would recommend and will definitely be back!.The pizza was good as usual. We ordered two pies ( white pizza and half buffalo chicken and half broccoli chicken) we ended up getting two artichoke slices because there was a piece of hair inside the pizza. The white pizza is my favorite. But the employee wasn't really nice. He's was really short with us and I felt like we were bothering him every time we had to ask or order something..The have written on the board its famous pizza place with many international locations.maybe famous for poor quality.i read mixed reviews and still ordered from the place .BIG MISTAKE.there were flies over the place when i went to Pick up my order.the pizza was not baked properly.if i could give i zero star i would..Normally I love this place but today I'm feeling some type of way. Their sign says 20$ for a Grandma pie. I ordered that and received a receipt for 42.00$ I ask what happened to 20$ the gentleman told me that that price isn't in effect anymore. Then he proceeded to tell me that it cost 5$ a slice and their menu says 4$. I incurred about that and he responded that the menu hanging isn't in effect. So basically because today is Pride, these guys want to upcharge us and exploit us..Friendly tip: cash only! Grandma slice! Comes in a huge square shape and is filling and might even be hard to finish! Extremely oily (but that's also what makes it that much more delicious) so if you're looking for a filling and grubby snack this is it..Fantastic!! Ordered 4 different pizzas plus garlic knots--very, very happy family!! Great taste, generous toppings & friendly service. Going again, maybe tonight!!"
"Absolutely the best chicken EVER. Always super fresh, Maduros are on point. Haven't tried anything else cuz the chicken is poultry-gasmic. Don't forget the red sauce!.Found a COCKROACH in my plate. Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary. Never coming back..I work around there so I eat there once in a blue an it's good just had lo mein an it was good plus there isn't a lot of Spanish restaurant nearby I recommend but I also think they should make a lunch special and add some fish on they menu so I can bring my boy some of there food.Love their chicken with vegetable fried chicken. The chicken can be salty sometimes but overall the flavor is always good. Make sure to ask for their green sauce!.Disappointed Placed an order 20 min prior to comingWaited 20 minutes more when arrivedWhen reached to work my order was incorrect Asked for garden rice with my order they gave me Fried rice could g return it was already at work When I ask server why I've been waiting so long because I called prior to coming No answer she whispered u just got hereThey will not get my business againI can find another place.Food is delicious here, way better than Caravan on Broadway.I come here all the time and the girls in front are swee, especially Yesenia.Tonight I saw her handle a crazy customer screaming about green sauce with such class..A cook wasn't wearing a mask.  I got scared and left.He had his mask on his chin, not covering his mouth or nose.That's the same as not wearing a mask at all!!.Their chicken and spare rib are so good!!  I always buy them when I'm around..Yum to their half chicken with red beans and rice- an $8.50 choice that is an incredibly generous portion of food that is good for two sittings. They also have the best tostones!.If you want some good, flavorful food, this is the spot! We ordered for take out. We ordered the half chicken with rice and beans. SO GOOD. The chicken is well seasoned, the beans are deelish and who doesn't love white rice! We also got the llomos soltado with garden rice and it also came with fries in there. So many flavors in this. I loved every bite of my meal. Last but not least we ordered a tub of that green sauce!! I could drink that sauce it's so good!  this was my first time trying out the food here and I recommend it to all.A huge plus point to this place is the portion! It's a lot of food and the pricing is great!.Love the chicken, but my favorite thing on the menu is the aguadito soup. Their green sauce is just ok..a bit too salty and not flavorful enough for my taste, but hubbie likes it just fine."
"Tearing up a bit while while scrolling through my pictures and seeing all my memories from Prune. . There is a short list of places special to me in NYC: ApothekeBuvettebut Prune has my heart--I remember meeting a dear friend for dinne there for the first time in 2001. From then I made this place my Thursday, blood and sand day. I miss you guys!! Harve at the corner having his dessert..The remoulade sauce with oyster omelette and the Famed Dutch baby is what finally placated next after  I ended up here one brunch day, looking for the perfect baked pancake. Cafe Luluc was on my mind all week but I didn't have a car to journey deep into Brooklyn . Manhattan was going to have to deliver and After searching the city's brunch seen far and wide, prune came as a lifesaver. Chef Gabrielle Hamilton is a genius wrapped into a food goddess. The icing on top of that wonderful meal with a little licorice puppy that came at the end with your check to bid adieu. Her creativity, decor and perfect execution of unique and novel French inspired dishes made the cozy space seem vast and welcoming. The vintage distressed mirrors lining the walls, the classic east village speakeasy vibe of bohemian, and the chic brunch goers all came together in a tapestry of the perfect New York City brunch. The restaurant is closed today after 20 years but it lives on in the hearts of those who ever ate here..This was my happy place; it was first meal out when I moved to NYC 8 years ago, and I've been back probably over 100 times since. The food is fantastic, and it has such a vibrant and warm atmosphere. I have so many wonderful memories here. When my friends and I all moved to NYC after college, we used to meet here on Sunday mornings to debrief the week/weekend. Someone would usually have a new guy/girl with them that they picked up the night before. Some of those people are now married or soon to be. We also went to Prune to mourn (and drown) our sorrows. We nursed a few deaths and heartbreaks here.I never write restaurant review, but I'm writing my first in hopes that maybe, if the owner sees how loved Prune is, she will reopen Prune. At least give us one more summer of bloody Marias and a chance to say goodbye!.I am so saddened to learn Prune has closed, and hoping they change their mind and reopen!  We came here in April 2019, visiting from San Francisco.  I am a native New Yorker and was so happy to find this intimate, personal, unique and beautiful restaurant.  The food was incredible, and we made some new friends sitting next to us.We planned to return every year.  We skipped last year due to Covid, but are just now feeling safe enough to return.  The first thing I did was check the website, hoping they survived these tough months.   This was a one of a kind, local experience..Prune is one of those neighborhood restaurants which serves high end cuisine behind a simple menu that are dying out against the backdrop of corporate restauranteurship in NYC.My fellow diners are all long term NewYorkers if not born here and regarded our meal as the quintessential old-school end to a New York evening event.Me, whilst I enjoyed everything I found the menu choices tough - spatchcock chicken is a rarity but I plumped instead for the duck. Tasty and nicely done.  Service is good and the small number of tables help ensure its intimacy.  Personally I felt the menu was a little too idiosyncratic and I struggled to make a choice (I will eat just about any dish FYI).A cute cafe serving elevated brunch food. I'm surprised the cafe has been around for 21 years and how did I just dined here, I don't know. To start, I love the decor of the place, from the subway tiled floor to the cozy table tops. The staff were great and attentive. They are strict about all the parties being present to be able to sit down, which is understandable since the cafe is tiny. My suggestion is to dine as they open for brunch, or to the end of brunch time because outside of those times, you will have to wait.The Bloody Mary menu for brunch was impressive with so many choices. My sister ordered the Danish Bloody Mary, garnished with anchovies and onion. It came with a chaser, which I thought was a bit odd, but when you sip the bloody and topped it off with the chaser, the Bloody was next level. Another plus was the Bloody was not salty. I ordered the fried oyster omelette and shared an order of potatoes rosti. The oysters were fried and breaded, mixed with the remoulade sauce and wrapped by a bright yellow omelette. A unique take of a brunch staple with a twist. I enjoyed each bite immensely and cleared my plate. The table shared the Dutch styled pancake, which I was expecting a more traditional iteration, unlike what was served, which was similar to a regular fluffy American pancake. A traditional dutch pancake has a crepe like texture, thin in nature and takes in the syrup. The Prune version has a hard exterior texture, fluffy inside and the syrup doesn't absorbed in the pancake. As an American pancake, it was unique since the toppings were pears, but nothing spectacular and 2 pieces of ham, can do without. I would dine here again because other dishes caught my eye..This NYC gem is celebrating 20 years this month, and their longevity is clearly well-deserved. Had dinner with my kids there last week, and wow... what an exceptional array of dishes. I was really intrigued by the brussel sprouts with grevenitz; taking an Ashkenazi treat of my youth and reimagining it as a veggie dish - and it's out of this world. The fats and crispy onion and chicken skin really bring out the brussel sprout flavor in a way I never imagined.Prune isn't a big place; but it's well staffed so service is always impeccable. There's also some seating at the bar for walk-ins, but I'd suggest making a reservation well in advance. I won't recount all the food we ate, let's just say every plate went back to the kitchen empty, and I'm looking forward to my next NYC visit to have another crack at the menu..Really excellent little brunch spot.  The food was outstanding.  I had the fried oyster omelet.  I hesitated in ordering it at first, but it was diving and i'm still dreaming about it.  I had a side of lamb sausage and brown bread.  Yum.  Coffee was really tasty as well.  Kudos to the servers for being surprisingly friendly (for NY), and for being attentive to our needs.  My only grip was that the place was tiny, the tables were small and you were almost on top of you neighboring table, so there was zero privacy.  It is NY but man was that tight.Expect to wait in line to get a table (outside I may add as there is no room to stand in the restaurant)..Popped in here to slake our thirst (aka remedy our horrific hangovers) mid-way during what turned out to be ~18K step river-to-river walk, from the edges of western SoHo where glass I-Banker-owned penthouse duplexes co-exist with the Holland Tunnel and Ear Inn, across to and through Chinatown to the edge of East River, back up through LES, into the Bowery, NoHo and back again. The Supergreens drinks, ibuprofen and multiple espressos had earlier in the day needed backup STAT. Prune is a tiny jewel of a restaurant which is almost always packed but it's relatively easy to snag one of the six seats at the bar, especially as a solo imbiber/diner. Thank Gods for small mercies as two seats were available when we walked in. I chose the Classico Bloody Mary from a list of several increasingly magical, complicated and seductive options, each probably gorgeously delicious, but simplicity--in the form of a celery stem and caper berry garnish plus a lemon wedge--at times is best, especially when reading hurts. At Prune a Bloody Mary is accompanied by a tiny glass of Pilsner-ish beer which works as a palate cleanser for those who eat as well as drink. It was my first time encountering such care. Thoughtful, right? We also ordered the ""Prune"" juice (nudge nudge wink wink) a signature blend of several fruits (none of which were prunes)--brightly pinkish-orange, that tasted like elegance, forgiveness, and citrus. It was perfect. By the way, the staff are always charming, warm, and super efficient--all of which are deeply appreciated whenever but especially when one is trying to recover from a big night out. Go. Have a Bloody Mary. Get a juice. Walk around a bit more. Thank me later quietly in your heart.  ps: I've had several incredible dinners at Prune over the years yet never brunch. This will have to change. I'll keep you posted!.This is a unique little gem on the boarder of LES and East Village. I had it saved on my bookmark list for quite some time and was excited when I finally went for brunch. Interior: I love the style of this place. It's nothing over the top, but is cute enough for Instagram. (Gotta relate to my audience, haha. ) I ordered the Monte Cristo- it was delicious and bursting with flavor. The service was good. I will add that I sat at the bar, and caught an interesting conversation happening with who I assumed to have been the owner and a guest that was dining. She seems sassy, which for me personally, made me like this place even more. It's spunky. There isn't a ton of seating (but really, where is there a ton of seating in this area?!), so you may want to get here on the early side and don't try to come with a large party. I look forward to coming back another time to try some more items for another brunch and dinner. 4/5"
"I seriously love this place! I come for the Tropical Açaí Bowl at least two times a week. Always great service and fast too! Thanks, Juicy Lucy!.Their juice is okay, but omg wayyyy over priced. $8 for orange juice? I'm not huge into juice, was just looking for a place to get a drink on a hot day. I really was interested in horchata because that's what the board out front advertised, but at the stand, it wasn't listed..Juicy Lucy Juice Bar is a little juice stand located in the East Village area.  They offer make-your-own options of juices (from a list of ingredients that include cantaloupe, celery, kale, parsley, beet, etc.), favorite combos/recommendations, smoothies, coffee, lemonades, teas, and other featured treats from local bakeries.  I tried the Hangover Cure, which was a combo of pineapple, lemon, and apple - this had more of a carrot taste to it, but it was still fresh-tasting and light.  I wished the drink was served cold, as it was semi-lukewarm.  There was a GF strawberry rice treat, so the hubs and I shared one of those (it wasn't actually tasty at all, as it wasn't moist and the 'strawberry taste' tasted like powder).  Service was straightforward and efficient, and there is a bench adjacent to the little hut to enjoy your beverages.+juices and smoothies made-to-order+coffees and teas also available+other treats from local bakeries available.I came here on Sunday afternoon at 3pm, hungover, and absolutely starving. I ordered their açaí smoothie for a whopping $9. The service was very fast and there are two cute benches on the right to sit down and people watch. I hate myself a little for spending $10 with tip for the smoothie, and also I was very desperate for some form of fruit, and I finished the smoothie in only a couple of minutes. (So did the girl sitting next to me haha). It's a bit pricey, but for the ingredients and taste it was pretty good. Usually a bottle of cold pressed juice is $9, so a full thick smoothie for that price isn't terrible...I'd come here to treat myself or after another long night out..I will not be back here. It looks so cute so I gave it a visit when I was craving a green juice. I chose the 'special green' and asked for medium. The woman worker made me a large and made me pay for it...I visited on Tuesday, July 3 when it was over 90 degrees outside. I understand the shack is small and all the fruits can't be stored in a refrigerator/freezer but I wish at least the worker added ice to the juice. The juice was super lukewarm, hotter than room temperature. It was not drinkable. Also, I love lots of ginger in my juice but there was way too much ginger in the juice I ordered here. I really questioned if either the fruit/greens were rotten or there was too much ginger. I made my friend check and make sure it was too much ginger and not rotten fruit. I had to add apple juice and ice to the juice to make it drinkable. I won't be returning or recommending..Inconsistent and dependent on who you get blending that day. **FYI, the phone number listed here is for Avenue A NOT the shack**The first time I got an acai bowl, it was amazing and the consistency was perfect. The second time, it was watery, with no consistency to it at all. The third time, chunks of fruit NOT blended. It was a waste of time and money. Every single time has been different and if it costs $11 to get a bowl, I'd recommend you go to another place that can actually deliver good quality every time..The owner was very rude. She yells at her employees in front of customers. Also the Quality is not the best for the price. Not going back!.Such a cute little stand! I stumbled across while I was walking around over the weekend. The two girls working were so nice and helpful, they gave great recommendations when I asked which smoothie to get. Such a nice and refreshing treat on a warm day!.No frills, cute coffee degustation stand; with happy barista.Serves cake, buns, rolls, croissants, fruit, cookies, juices and great - speak actually hot - coffee. Ask for an extra sugar to bring out flavor. They serve Java in cups; that actually do not leak on seam (light-years ahead of Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks). Vibrant colors all hours of the day.Positive influence experience in dull city! Amazing what a bit of simplicity does.Rebel Review: 5 stars..I say this for your own good:Do not skip dinner.Do not stay out drinking past 3 am. Do not drink with Australians. (AKA do not do jager bombs.)Do not smoke cigarettes.Do not urinate in public. (Seriously, it's illegal.)Do not agree to meet family in Brooklyn Chinatown at 11 am the next morning.But if you must do all these things, go get yourself a Hangover Cure at the outpost of Juicy Lucy's at the Nexus of the Universe. The combination of pineapple, lemon and apple juices will do wonders for you, even if it is overpriced at $4.(Especially when combined with a bacon, egg and cheese. Or if you're rich, a $10 everything bagel with smoked salmon, tomato, onion, and scallion cream cheese from Russ & Daughters located just across Houston.)"

"A great sushi bar in Marriott.Friday night we were headed to this restaurant for dinner. We had 'Sushi Plate' and some vegetarian rolls and Udon. Sushi plate was amazing! It had the right portion for me and the variety of sushi! Spider roll was huge. Tasted goo too! However, Udon wasn't good; I believe Udon is one of the most basic Japanese food. This restaurant made the soup with Japanese Kimchi I think, so the soup was sour which isn't right! and Egg... No it shouldn't be called Udon.I was very disappointed, but chocolate desserts and nice warm green tea covered the gap of Udon. Chocolate desserts were literally amazing! and the green tea wasn't too hot. The tea and desert was the perfect combination!!!I saw a couple of groups of businessmen. I think this place is good for business meeting/dinner! :).I didn't really hold out much hope for Katen as it's a hotel restaurant but having faith in my fellow Yelp!ers I plunged ahead - and I'm sort of glad I did.The restaurant is open plan in the Atrium on the 8th floor. It doesn't have a lot of atmosphere but it's cozy enough and the staff are very friendly and efficient. My first impression of the menu was that it was a little pricey, even for a hotel in NYC but once the Sushi Plate arrived it was actually a good amount of food.The miso soup was just OK and, while I initially thought the salad looked unappetizing with its gunky orange dressing, it was actually fresh-tasting, spicy and sweet. So, you may be expecting me to say the sushi was amazing. It wasn't, but it was good. The fish was fresh and cut thickly, the rice had a perfect texture but a tad too much vinegar and the maki, while very tasty were, frankly, pretty poorly rolled.None of those things killed the meal for me, I quite enjoyed it, but as my school reports used to say, 7 out of 10, could do much better especially with a final check for $48 for one person - that's the sushi plate menu and a beer..I came here with a friend on a Wednesday night. There were two sushi chefs working. We sat in the tiny round step-down area. We ordered salmon sashimi, uni sushi (off the menu), hamachi sashimi, and a spider roll, all of which turned out to be OK sushi, but nothing special or high quality sushi by any means for the price that we paid. I guess I shouldn't expect much for dining in a hotel restaurant. However, it is convenient to walk downstairs for sushi if you're living in the hotel..I appreciate creative sushi....however let's not get crazy.  I am somewhat to blame for ordering what I did but when the description had the word mango, I thought it would be little pieces maybe rolled into the roll instead of mango syrup basically drenching each piece.  Gross.  The service was very slow to boot which didn't help things.  I will say that my gut was telling me not to even try this joint b/c it's in a hotel and restaurants in hotels rarely make an impression on me but it was late and I wanted sushi.Steer clear of Katen..Pretty affordable for sushi in the Marriott. I got the Bento Box which came with a great salad, dumplings (vegetable), California roll, edamame. The California roll was tasty and the dumplings weren't greasy and the salad wasn't overdressed which was great. All of this came for $18 which I think was very reasonable given what we think about upscale hotels.Good lunch..For a Mid-town surprise setting with fresh, flavorful & creative Sushi/Sashimi, drop in on Katen.  On the expansive 8th floor plaza of the Marriott with prime views of Times Square, you can enjoy top quality fresh food created by some enormously talented chefs including Chef Kwan, Chef Freddie & Chef Carlos.  The servers (mine was named  May) are Asian and bring a wonderful grace to your table that is a refreshing change from the abundance of theatricals who support themselves as waiters in between engagements. Yesterday I indulged with friends tasting soft shell crab, shrimp, rainbow roll, spicey tuna & assorted sashimi.  Try Katen, you will enjoy your new Times Square discovery..Ate here while staying at the hotel for business. Fresh sushi in a nice clean environment..YUCK.....was here late night and got the shrimp tempura roll.  The tempura was made prior in the day and was cold and clammy.  The roll itself was loose and not put together well and probably the worse part about it was the mango sauce.  I almost spit the whole thing out.  I was thinking 'how could anyone screw up tempura anything?'  Oh this is how.  What a nightmare.  Will never return.  YUCK!!!.It's closed? Since when?? I was there last month for lunch. I had miso soup and sushi. The miso soup was good. The sushi was okay. I had better sushi elsewhere. Affordable considering it's in the Marriott in the middle of Times Square. Very nice atmosphere..SHORT & SWEET; what a hidden little gem of a sushi bar; great sushi smack dab in the middle of a Times Square Marriott lobby?  You bet your unagi roll!  Let's not get carried away, this is no life-altering sushi experience; but who can beat the convenience? Sushi is fresh and the nigiri is properly sized; sushi chefs operate in a robotic trance, oblivious to patrons (customer-chef intimacy is not fostered by having to order from the waitresses, usually never a good sign).  The rolls are worth a try."
"My experience was a little different than the standard one because I used the app Too Good To Go, which gives a significant discount for end-of-the-day baked goods. But you don't know what you're going to get ahead of time. I paid $5 and was given five enormous baked goods in return. Not all of them were things I would have chosen for myself, but all of them were like normal/mainstream baked goods. The woman let me choose a flavor of cookie too, and I opted for chocolate chunk. They weren't the best baked goods I've ever had in my life, but they were good and definitely hit the spot, especially for the price I paid for them. Minus one star because the pickup experience was a little confusing - the women working were kind but seemed to be confused by what I was there for. Anyway, would def do this pickup from the app again..I mean it was dank. I don't understand why it was so thick but it was haha. Delicious. You can really taste the difference between the black and white chocolate. Light and fluffy like a cake but also dense enough to stay together..Horrible, absolutely horrible. The nerve of these people charging $10.55 for grilled chicken wrap the size of a toddlers arm, with over 150 ingredients, cheap flavorless tasting wrap, barely any chicken, little to no lettuce..What an inefficient place. Poorly run. Wait on line for 10 minutes for your coffee, and then someone can make your sandwich and you'll have to wait another 10 minutes. But the guys making the food are just standing their. Can't wait until this place closes down and they open up a Starbucks- these clowns can't run a business This is not a family business otherwise they wouldn't exploit workers and run an incredibly poor business.You can actually smell the fresh breads and bakery goods when walking in the vicinity of this location in penn station. Never thought something could make penn station smell good!This location was also very clean and open unlike a lot of the other penn station food spots. Quick easy grab and go or sit down. The challah is soo yum and so are their cookies. Their pretzels looked really good too!If I ever need to kill time in penn station, this will be where I do so along with a sweet treat..Oh my God, Zaro's Family Bakery - Amtrak Rotunda was certainly phenomenal. Overall, I think Zaro's Family Bakery - Amtrak Rotunda is a great, fun spot. Absolutely yummy and also wholesome. Staff ensured that every thing was o. k. Love that spot! Will be back..Ordered and paid for a LOX and cream cheese bagel, received just cream cheese bagel...This is after I was charged extra for tomatoes that I did not ask for. Just a super experience all around..My wife and I have been coming here for years. The baked goods are absolutely the best around; very authentic and made with quality ingredients. A good example is the apple turnover: a wonderful filling made with real apples (not overly processed like at most places), ensconced in a light, buttery and flaky crust. Wow..Great place to get a breakfast or lunch sandwich. After I had already bought my premade ham sandwich, for $10.75, I realized that they make fresh sandwiches for $8.75. Why would you get a premade one when you can get a fresh one?! Lesson learned for next time.  Long line of people waiting here and not at other places is a recommendation in itself....Arghh Zaro's has so much potential, but I've never had a great experience there. It has the makings of being a gem in the awfulness that is Penn Station, but something has been wrong every time I've eaten there - stale bagels at 8 am (!), aloof service, or confusing signage on where to order.Inclined to give it two stars for my frustrations, but let's be serious at least it's better than Dunkin."
"I would give 100/10 if I could! If your near the area and want AMAZING Italian food you have to visit here. Literally no other Italian restaurant does it better. The food is insane and is my go to spot for authentic Italian food. My family and I have gotten to know the owner Marcello over the years, and he's the kindest person with so much heart. I've gone to this restaurant numerous times in the span of 6 years and the food has never disappointed. My sister and I could be indecisive but he always gives the best suggestions. I highly recommend!!.They had great food. They made me something special that wasn't on the menu. Most importantly they have amazing food and service and I highly recommended it..This restaurant is a gem! Marcelo made us feel like we were family. We were catered to customized menu dependent on what type of food we preferred. The beet salad was spot on! The lamb shank - superb! The  American sea bass with roasted potatoes and vegetables - to die for!Celebrating my cousin's birthday - Marcelo went the extra mile and treated us like royalty. My new favorite go-to whenever I am in NY!.Been going here for many years. After Covid things are different. Food is still great, but there are no waiters who I used to know. The owner does all the order taking and serving, so when I tip, I'm not sure who is getting the money. They say you're not supposed to tip the owner so where is the money going? The specials are always the same, never anything different. I'm looking for a little more variety, and for things to go back to normal, meaning pre-covid..We came here for my husband's birthday with the family. Very traditional old school Italian place. Owner was very friendly and gave my 2 yo a little bear when we arrive. They had delicious specials as well as a variety menu. Everyone in our party was happy with their order and let me tell you it's very rare. We will definitely return!.When the mandate changes, a restaurant MUST check for vaccination cards and ID.  Neither was asked for and that's the reason for my three-star review.  These are non-negotiables in dining in these days!  Food is above average and portions are adequate.  Although my friend's eggplant rollatini was served barely warm; not hot.  Nice touch to add veggies to a veal dish that is already stuffed with spinach..Food was excellent. Fresh grated cheese on the spaghetti. The service made the meal a true delight..The definition of ""feel like home"". I can just imagine the owner, who is at your every beck and call, is probably in the back making the actual dishes. I almost felt bad for not eating all my vegetables. A nice, clean, quiet place, with impeccable service and even better food. Classic Italian cuisine, a plethora of options; there's really something for everyone. And the owner coming by and checking on you? You just don't get that anymore. Will definitely be back..From the outside it looks mehhh but wowwww authentic italian food!!! Everything was fresh and u can choose whatever u want to eat even if it's not in the menu. The owner Marcello is incredible. I wish more ppl knew about it!.This is an AUTHENTIC ITALIAN RISTORANTE!!! The food is amazing! There is such a variety of things to choose from. The service is TOP NOTCH!!! When you go to La Grotta... You feel like you are in Italy! They really know how to make you feel like family! La Grotta is more of an experience!  Do yourself a favor and go!!!! I had a graduation meal there for a famly member. Our party consisted of roughly 25 people and when I tell you,  every course came out hot, fresh and delicious! I want to add that when our entree came out we had eaten so much food that many of us was really full!!! And please have the tiramisu... it is out of this world!!!"
"Came in (sadly, just after happy hour was over where part of the menu and drinks are basically half price) with my partner, my friend and his infant. They definitely had quite a few tables filled which was an indicator that the restaurant must be good. We got a corner table with a child chair which made it quite easy for us to enjoy our meal comfortably.I will say, the menu is quite limited versus all the pictures that yelp has. Many of those meals are no longer on the menu, so beware of that. With that said, the menu has very typical items that you will find at most Mexican restaurants. Something, that I wish they had on their menu was the fact that they make a margarita pitcher for $70 which serves around 7 glasses. We asked, and ordered it in a heartbeat, but considering that the individual margaritas were just about as much, I'm not quite sure that it was a great deal with it.We got he guacamole which was tasty, but considering we were 3 adults and one infant eating form it... it did not last long. We asked for medium but it actually was more like mild. The chips that accompanied the guacamole, were crunchy and lightly salted. Moving on to our food, we ordered 2 orders of the chicken chilaquiles and I ordered the al-pastor fish tacos. These tacos are an order of 3 that can come in either corn or flour tortillas, I chose corn. These were quite delicious, small, but filling meals. The fish was cut up in small squares and there served with a green tomatillo style sauce that I thought would be spicy, but after tasting it, realized it was actually just mild, and proceeded to pour that over my tacos. I was satisfied with my meal. Let me add that service was great, and the restaurant was nice and decor was what you expect to see in a restaurant in a touristy Mexican destination. Light after 7 gets dimmed down in the restaurant set for a chill mood. So far, everything sounds great and the only reasons I don't give this restaurant a 5 star is because, compared to other restaurants, I do find that the meals are overpriced, especially as they are not big plates. I also struggled finding anything on that menu that looked unique (besides the al-pastor fish tacos, which sounded like a fun spin on my two favorite tacos). The happy hour menu seemed like it would have definitely been worth it and sitting at the bar with some friends. The weird thing is, I liked it, but I don't think I would be back, just because of dollar per dollar value. As per review tradition, I truly think this is could be a great first date location. Especially after 7 when lighting is set low, music is playing in the background, candles are lit on the tables, and noise level of other guests is quite tolerable, but pretty sure it could also be a great second or third date for happy hour at the bar!.I work in the neighborhood and have been to this restaurant several times.  They have great lunch specials ranging from $11-$20 which is reasonable for the upper west side. All of the lunch specials come with Mexican-style rice, refried beans, corn or flour tortillas and your choice of chips and salsa, chicken soup or salad. The last time I visited, I came with two friends. We decided to share an order of guacamole.  The guacamole can be made to your spice level.  It's a small dish for $14 but it comes with unlimited chips. I ordered the mixed (shrimp, steak and chicken) fajitas and a side of sopa de pollo (chicken soup).  The sopa was delightful.  It was topped with a lot of chopped cilantro and onions and had a nice clear broth. My friend got the Tampiqueña lunch special which is a grilled skirt steak with cheese enmolada and guacamole.  I was very jealous I did not order this as the steak was freaking delicious.  The steak was grilled perfectly and very tender.  And it tasted wonderful with the guacamole.My other friend ordered the Tinga de Pollo which is shredded chicken simmered in tomato sauce.  This was also very good and very filling. I must say the staff here is great.  They come by several times to check on you, to refill your water and to give you more chips.  The food comes to your table fast which is why I often come here on my lunch hour.  We love it here and will continue to come back..Quite possible the worst meal I have ever had in NYC. No, actually, it is the WORST meal I have had in NYC! And it is difficult to mess up Mexican food!!Cafe Frida is recommended in the Michelin guide...why??? I have no idea because the food is nothing short of disgusting. Not to mention over priced!!!! $14 for guacamole. $14!?!?!!! Even by upper west side standards that's insane.  $72 for a pitcher of margaritas- what???? $72?????? Um no, just no, that's just wrong.  It takes a special skill to screw up fajitas and Cafe Frida did it!  It was mostly veggies, barely any protein, and all covered in a weird seasoning that was gross. Skinny margarita, tasted like pool water. Not a single good thing about this place. We had to go somewhere else afterwards for a decent meal and to get rid of the gross taste of Cafe Frida. Do not recommend..Dinner here was tasty, unique, and slow. So if you have some time I would highly recommend this nouveau Mexican cuisine place. There is not enough good Mexican food in NY so this place stands out.Food: 5/5.  I had the tlacoyos which are fried blue corn masa boats packed with skirt steak, fresh pico, cheese and onions. They came with a side of some of the tastiest salsa verde I have had. And they looked pretty amazing too, with the purple/blue corn boat standing out. Also had some of the medium spicy guacamole which wasn't spicy but still tasty. And the chips were great too.Drinks: 5/5. the mezcalita was perfect; spicy and woody, yet crisp and sweet. The hibiscus margarita was good too, but on the sweeter side. Fairly strong too so after two I was feeling too good to drive home!Service: 3/5.  The staff was friendly when they came by, which was not that often. They didn't fill our water after the initial sweep, so we had to ask for more.  However, it wasn't the worst Other: 4/5.  the bathroom has an outer door and an inner door. This is a touch of luxury. We sat near the bathrooms and because of the two door system, we never saw or smelled the inside of the bathroom. Heaven..Definitely NYC prices. Great happy hour prices, amazing margaritas. Guacamole never a disappointment. Always had steak tacos. Staff were amazing.We were lucky to find empty tables here on 1 of the hottest days of the year. We ordered the guacamole to start. The mild guacamole still had a bit of a kick to it and the chips that come with were warm. We all thought the guacamole was perfectly made.I ordered the ""Frida"" drink which consisted of tequila, agave, and lime juice. Simple, but quite good. We also ordered the burrito, the steak and mushroom quesadillas and the chicken enchiladas. Everything was super tasty and we will definitely be back here. Service was also good as I love a glass full of water at all times..We know Mexican food and were happy to find this in the neighborhood. Had some delicious guacamole and the Mexican beer version of a margarita... can't remember the name..then we both ordered vegetarian versions of tacos and chili relleno. Both were new takes on old favorites. Service was prompt and courteous. We didn't have reservations so they initially seated us in the back but were happy relocate us to the patio..We went to Cafe Frida for lunch and the foods and drinks were great. However I found the place a bit pricey, especially we were there during lunch time. 3 people and the bill was over $200. So be prepared....Our experience was very quick, only stopped in for a drink and a snack at the bar. Sat at the bar and immediately was greeted. I loved that during cold weather there is a curtain to hide the wind when the front door opens, the bar is right at the front, not too many people in the place when we stopped by(lunchtime). We really enjoyed the guacamole, all portions looked small. This is a cute dive in Mexican spot to stop by after a nice long walk in Central Park..I feel like i had to post this since google reviews are so good it was enticing but we did have a different experience. We ate here for dinner, around 7pm and ordered a bunch of items including the guac, enchilada suizas, their special Frida margarita and the mixed (chicken and steak) fajitas. All of which had fantastic reviews. The place was packed and the service was good. The drink was strong and the ambiance is right but holy cow..! I tasted the enchilada and there was something off about the suizas. The smell was weird and i always order this at mexican restaurants. My hubby ate the suizas, my daughter ate the chicken from the fajitas and since the steak was very tough i ate majority of the veggies from the fajitas with the rice and beans. Our bill was a hefty $104 for 3, which is not bad but not great for the quality and type of restaurant. On the drive home, my husband complained of bad reflux and my stomach was unsettled. The little one was sick by midnight and puked everything she ate. She thought it was the chicken. I had very bad gas, and stomach pains from the evening to the following morning. We all had to stay home the next day to get it out of our systems. I would give this place zero if i could. Be careful what you order and perhaps stay away from the chicken."
"Eaters.com and infatuation.com should have this on the list of best pizza/italian in brooklyn. I dont live in the immediate area but I come over to get the eggplant roll because its best one Ive eaten and Ive tried many. Its not as doughy, has alot of eggplant and has two types of cheese. I had the grandma slice from managers suggestion and Im happy I did ..its excellent. Their other slices look great too, it always looks very fresh.  Thanks!.So this used to be my go-to pizza place. They were always kind and delivered on time. I moved residences (still in the neighborhood) and I don't know what the change was but they've become total douche bags. One time I ordered online and it never arrived......Tried again another time to give another chance.... weather was cloudy. It snowed couple days prior, cold. And they called me and gave me an ultimatum of increasing my tip to more than 20% due to the ""inclement weather"" (it was CLOUDY. there was no inclement weather. No snow or rain. Just past snow from a few days prior) or told me to cancel my order. So I canceled my order. Idk what the heck happened to this place but there's many pizza spots in bay ridge. Ya quickly gonna run out of business if u continue to act like this..The Grandma's pie - crisp, thin crust, fresh lightly cooked tomatoes, abundant (but not overwhelming) mozzarella...Have I died and gone to heaven?  Nope.  I walked up the block and gone to Nino's..Nino's used to be a good establishment, but now it is run by scumbags. Terrible customer service. The people they have working the counter are absolutely horrible, unprofessional, nasty, rude and gross human beings - especially the one with the ginger beard. In my most recent interaction, I ordered a pie via phone and when I went to pick it up - they gave me the wrong pie and refused to rectify the order and give me what I had originally called in. I hope El Pres gets there one day and gives them a very unflattering review and reveals their true colors. Do not recommend going and supporting such an awful group of people..The overall rating of this pizzeria is spot on. 3.5/5 is the right rating. Like that is what I would give it myself if I could.The location is sublime, but I will get to the pizza first. The pizza is a bit on the chewy side, but the tomato sauce comes through in a nice, beautiful, red sauce. It is a cheesy slice, so it helped that I purchased a Ginger Ale with it. The owner (very friendly man by the way) told me he likes to put a lot of cheese on his slices - the white slice I ordered had four kinds of cheese on it! The crust? It needed some more time in the oven. But overall it is a solid slice in a solid neighborhood.This pizzeria is in a quiet part of Brooklyn, Bay Ridge. It is quaint, with nobody to hassle you in any way. I also found the people there very nice and friendly. While reading the reviews for Nino's, I noted that the Verrazzano Bridge is right near the pizzeria; if you walk a few blocks up, take a bench and enjoy your pizza. That is exactly what I did, I walked up to the waterfront with my purchase, took a bench, and ate my slices as the sun set behind the Verrazzano Bridge on such a glorious day.As the sun is setting for me in Brooklyn for my search for the best pizza slice in New York City, I do not think Nino's has the best slice in the city. However, Nino's is perfect for that perfect day to watch a perfect sunset in a pretty perfect location, despite its imperfections..Best pizza, delicious dinners. You can't go wrong. Quick delivery. Excellent food!Best chicken Caesar pizza ever! Chicken Marsala with homemade linguine is excellent! They are my go-to when I don't feel like cooking. The people that work there are just as great as the food, such a pleasure..There was a man standing, literally as you walk in leaning over the counter without a mask, and no one was saying anything so I did. They allowed him to stand around and touch things, as well as lean over the counter WITHOUT A MASK.And again, no one said anything. Then the guy making pizza and such had his mask pulled down almost the entire time I was inside. There are plenty of other good pizza spots, in bay ridge at the same price point.Side note: I wasn't a fan of their pizza, but wanted to try again to support a local spot. YIKES..Good Brooklyn pizza ! The prices are great , Lots of options and the thin crust on this grandama slice was so good They don't over crisp it.I've been ordering from Nino's for years, simply because it's convenient and, usually, quick. I find it interesting that the pies ordered Mon-Thurs taste much better than the ones ordered on Fri-Sun. Sometimes you get an undercooked, doughy, pie. Overall, the pizza is consistently good, as is the quick delivery..I recently stopped in and picked up a small chicken parm sandwich that was in the front case.  Within a few hours of eating it, I began feeling ill with cold-like symptoms.  I've now been sick for a couple of days.  I wish food handlers would comprehend the importance of keeping their hands clean, and their work surfaces clean.  This is one reason I rarely buy food out..I only know the Spinach Roll, which I consider one of the two finest in bklyn. Lots of spinach and good cheese is my standard. Go for it !"
"Honestly still my fave Ethiopian place in NYC!I came here with a group of friends last week and we had the best time and our bellies were full!It's a hidden gem on MacDougal, right next to WSP. It gets really packed so make sure you come early or be prepared to wait. We ordered the:Combo Platter- We asked for the portion to be for 4 people and it was more than enough. It comes with various veggie + meat combos and they are VERY generous with the amount of injera they give you. It's family style and you eat with your hands, it's my fave part :) All the flavors are amazing, spices are rich, and meat is very tender.Sambosa:- We ordered 2 meat and 2 lentil. It's a classic sambosa -- flakey and crispy shell and tender filling. I wish they were a bit bigger though!Honey Beer- you MUST try this! I hate beer but this is honestly a must try. it's light and almost taste like a tootsie roll? I can't explain it, just try it!The service isn't good, i'm telling you right now but if you can overlook that, you'll have a great time!.Came across this place while walking around that street. It's like a hidden gem, you might walk past it but don't sleep on this place! The veggie combo is my absolute favorite, which is crazy because i love meat, but that literally shows how great the flavors are~Portion sizes are great, you can share this with two people and be full. They always give some extra injera too ;)I  love that this place is authentic, the owners are all Ethiopian. They're so sweet and hardworking, and you can taste it in the food! I would recommend getting some kind of combo on the menu so you can try as much as possible.You can eat inside or you can take it to the park and enjoy some fresh air..I Called this place and they told me they wouldn't take reservations. When we got there, there was absolutely NO ONE THERE. I opened the door, and there were 2 employees just sitting in the dining room in their phones. Not a great first impression, but I get it because there was no one there. However, the place looked dirty so we decided to leave. They should have taken the reservation, and maybe we would have felt in debt and stayed. With that said, we didn't try the food..I've been a consistent, loyal Meskerem customer since 2010. It's been 11 years and I'm still with them. And will continue to be as long as I am a New Yorker.One of the waitresses is a bit passive-aggressive, a bit loopy, but I ignore her in favor of the food whose flavorful consistency cannot be replicated. Anywhere.I recently visited Washington, D.C. and my hotel was located in the City Center district. I think I was there for 3-4 days and I had a really difficult time finding good, quality food for the duration of my visit. One of those days I tried ordering delivery to my hotel from an Ethiopian restaurant in DC and I almost cried. It was that bad.I couldn't wait to return to NYC where restauranteurs put love, care, and quality into their cuisine. I feel like very little can compare to NYC food. Thank you for years of great cuisine Meskerem!.LOVE this place.  They use the best seasonings, and I don't know what their secret is, but they throw down on their veggie lunches and dinner plates.  A fan of Ethiopian food, Meskerem is such a jewel that I sometimes go just to satisfy my cravings for their berbere.  LOL  Mostly eat at the Village location, but have eaten at the Hell's Kitchen location one time.  Tip: They will let you buy a bottle of their own label Ethiopian Honey Wine to-go, as long as you open it in the restaurant and have at least one glass.  It's not strong, but it is sweet and tasty, and adds a nice little flavor to your meal..Came thru on a recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint!This was my third(?) time eating Ethiopian food & Meskerem has to be my fave. We split a veggie combo, another combo of some sort, special tibs (per our waitress's suggestion), and a bunch of fluffy, spongey injera. I have no clue what any of the sauces/mixes were but they tasted great and paired great with the injera. I've had injera in the past that was too sour but these were fermented to very manageable level. For refer3 food orders (plus extra injera) satiated 4 ravenous girls. Only downside is that the service isn't super friendly, but oh well. The food speaks for itself..This is my third time being here (2nd time alone) I think what drives me hear is that it excites my palate & also makes me more curious of what other kinds of food I have never had. I can't wait to come back with my family & more friends because I just wanna try everything at once. Pleeease don't gooo.The best Tej in NYC hands down! I've been coming here for years with my family- and out of all the Ethiopian restaurants- this is hands down the best..I was craving Ethiopian food - glad I came to Meskerem! I was seated immediately. After ordering, food came out pretty quick as well. Ordered the meat vegetarian combo which was delicious and a lot of food for one person. Really loved the miser wot and one of the spicy meat dishes included in the combo. Glad to have tried Meskerem and excited to go back again soon!.It was a great experience eating at Meskerem! The staff was very friendly and helpful with questions we had. The wait for the main course was on the longer end of the spectrum but not overly long. The appetizers came out quick!After trying multiple Ethiopian restaurants, this is my favorite in NYC. The food has rich flavor and it was hard to choose a favorite dish among the combo platters. There was a good mix of spicy and non spicy dishes and the injera tasted very fresh. The appetizer sambosas were delicious and went perfectly with the sauce they came with.The portions were very generous and a really good value. Will be coming back here very soon!.I am so bummed. I've been coming here since 2013 and I've never seen the service and ambiance be so low -- they had such a rude waiter who kept talking back, and forgetting about customers (not even bringing napkins, etc). I am sad to say I am no longer going to come here.I'd also like to add one more unfortunate point: there were homeless individuals there loitering. In general, with the hostile waiter and a crowd that is comprised of people who aren't even customers, this place is now unsafe and unpleasant..The food was great..sombosa with lentils was delicious.Vegetable combo had few nice lentil based dishes..the red curry had a tinge of spice which suited my palette the most. The vegetables balanced the spices in the lentils. The Injera bread tastes a lot like a dosa which is a South Indian delicacy and was tangy . Only disappointment was the quantity was less for the price."
"This establishment cares about the community of Sunset Park. Yesterday, I went to La Isla on behalf of Dawud Gaston, business owner of Ooolala Films, community leader and, one of the original founders of the Annual Sunset Park Puerto Rican Parade. I spoke with the manager Eddie in regards to giving back. The owner gave his blessing to provide delicious food at a very fair price for the Women's shelter and the First Responders in Sunset Park. Thank you La Isla for helping your community when we need you most! Sincerely,Kammalech Ramos, President of Pa'lante.First and foremost people , there is a rating of ""C"" in the window , wake up !!! This is the lowest rating that is given by the NYC DEPT OF HEALTH. This means they have found roaches , vermin infestation , dirty food prep , storage and utensils. Plus cross contamination surfaces. Old and putrid meats. This is appalling. I have eaten here before ( no it is NOT puerto rican cuisine ) , it appears everyone is of Dominican decent including the cook. The food was bland and the pernil that was served looked like the scrapings off the bone , which IMMEDIATELY sent me into the restroom to relive my self. That is a definite sign of mild food poisoning caused by E coli !!! The neighborhood patrons have to inform themselves and the local politicians to demand the same quality food as in the more affluent areas. Stay away , stay away. As the saying goes , "" you get what you pay for "". Just because its cheap does not make it fresh. It is a clear indication that the owners are more concerned about selling you crap as opposed to quality , soley on the basis of an assumption of poorly educated and perhaps low income patrons. Demand better !!! Unite and boycott this dump until they get thier act together. We need a great choice of quality fresh food and friendly , welcoming workers. Try that shit in Park slope and they would be closed within a month..Added my review to show some love to a great simple place serving up Dominican food fast cheap and good.  Didn't understand y the other la islas got SO MANY reviews but than realized that sunset park probably doesn't have to many yelpers unlike the amazingly fabulous incredible and yelperirrific park slop or willy burg.I've been eating here for over 2 years even though on my way to the restaurant i have 4 more spanish places to get food from. This place far exceeds the rest. The girls are great...Yesenia and Patty do a great job at getting my order right and quickly all the time!!! If you are in the vicinity drop by...anything you order is ""To die for!"" lol"
"This is one of my favorite spots for breakfast/lunch, but their bakery is just as top notch! I knew I needed to share this today to celebrate national chocolate cake day!If there is a long wait or you are just looking for some grab and go pastries, you can get their sweet treats at the front of the restaurant! The scones are an obvious must try (the pumpkin caramel is my fav), but my absolute favorite slice of chocolate cake in the city is here! The chocolate cake is light and moist. It has a great rich chocolate flavor that compliments the vanilla buttercream icing perfectly. I loved it so much I actually bought their cookbook and made the cake for my mom for her birthday! It was just as delicious!All this writing about chocolate cake makes me want a piece lol! I am definitely adding stopping by Alice's to this week's to do list :).Cute grandmas house decor, great place to meet some folks without committing to a meal. Easy to make reservations online. I also saw that they offer kids that come in little fairy wings - very cute. Of the things I received in the tea set: 1) the sandwiches were super dry and not very flavorful 2) the cake and cookies were extremely sweet; cookies tasted almost store bought 3) the flavored scones were good4) the buttermilk scone was excellentI came back another day to just get a buttermilk scone later but they ran out, so be aware of that..The Madhatter was perfect for two, especially if you were on empty bellies. Love love the cute stand and how they stage everything. The savory scone (bacon and cheese?) was surprisingly good ; salmon sandwich was a bit disappointing as it has nothing else on it; all the sweets on the bottom were quite yummy too, despite cake being a bit hard. We sat at the outdoor dining area and service did not forget us even though we were the only table outside..After spending more than 8 years in the UK and now that my parents have moved to London, I am bred in the bone to love Tea Houses. This is something I truly missed in the US. But, my search ends with Alice's Tea Cup, NYC's whimsical tea room with the best scones I've had in the city. We got the tea for 2 with unlimited tea (really good tea), choice of three scones (served with jam and cream), choice of two tea sandwiches, mocha cake and many other assortments. The scones were so good! The scone menu varies daily so check with sever for the day's special! Go join the Mad Hatter's Tea Party!.I took my sister here to celebrate her birthday. We didn't have a reservation and came on a Saturday afternoon but surprisingly, there was only a 20 minute wait! The major draw of having high tea here is the ambiance. We were choosing between different tea spots and there are many with better pricing and better food, but she liked the tea parlor ambiance here. I definitely felt transported to the set of Alice's tea party from the movie. While waiting, we had admired the long selection of teas being offered and naturally chose the Mad Hatter Tea for Two so we could try unlimited tea. Actually, they only offer unlimited refills on the two teas you choose originally, but our server was so generous and allowed me to try one additional one as a courtesy. The teas were phenomenal and the most memorable part of the experience. I had the Rooibos Coconut Vanilla and the Green Tea Chai. I love milk tea, and had both of these with milk and honey. The food paled in comparison to the tea. We were allowed to choose three scones, two tea sandwiches, a pastry in addition to the assortment of cookies provided. The scones were MASSIVE. Each one was the size of a mug. I didn't really like the cheddar scone but the vegan lemon blueberry was scrumptious and the pumpkin chocolate chip was delicious as well. The sandwiches were awesome but this was the only savory component of the tea service and should have been more extensive in comparison to the sweets. The few slivers of smoked salmon and cucumber sandwiches we had were nothing compared to the mountains of sweets we ingested. Our mocha cake was moist and decadent, but the cookies were hard and way too sweet. For me, the whole experience was a little too expensive and overzealous with the amount of sweets provided. I would have appreciated more sandwiches as a substitute for the cookies or cake but there wasn't that option. Great service and tea, but I'd rather do my own tea service at home with some homemade sandwiches and scones..Came here for a womens' getaway tea and had the back room to ourselves.  Very very fun!  And way too much food (although we ordered ahead of time).  We got the assortment of scones, finger sandwiches and dessert.  My favorite part of tea is clotted cream and jam on top of scones.  And they had it.  We enjoyed the sandwiches too.  Cookies were not amazing, so we passed on those.  Took home 1/3 of the scones!.Such a cute spot for tea and we spotted Anne Hathaway and her husband just when we are done. This place has indoor and outdoor seating. No reservation required. If you need to call this location for whatever reason, call the Chapter 2 at the East Side because this location doesn't pick up their phone. Nevertheless, they have 4 tea sets:1. Tea & Scones: comes with choice of 2 scones and a cup of tea with 3 free refills. 2. Nibble: tea for 1 with unlimited refills. Comes with choice of 1 scone, 1 sandwich, and assorted mini cookies.3. Madhatter: tea for 2 with unlimited refills. Comes with choice of 3 scones, 2 sandwiches, 1 cake, and assorted mini cookies. +$15 extra to make it tea for 3.4. Jabberwocky: unlimited tea, unlimited scones, unlimited sandwiches, 1 cake, and assorted cookies for 2 hours time limit. +$11 extra to make it tipsy tea with 1 glass of Prosecco or house wine.Scones: They gave us 5 scones to choose from and I highly recommend their chocolate scone. It was so warm and flavorful. The vegan strawberry scone and the buttermilk scone were okay. Although I do also wanna try their pumpkin caramel scone. Sandwiches: I really liked their smoked salmon sandwich. Their lapsang chicken sandwich was okay, although it pair well with stardust tea. Their curried chicken sandwich is more popular than their lapsang chicken. Cake: We were given a choice of their chocolate cake and their mocha cake. We opted for the mocha cake. It was a bit dry and too sweet.Assorted cookies: They only have chocolate chip cookies that day. It was okay. It would be nice if it was warm and freshly made. Tea: They have a large tea selection. We opted for their Silver Needle Jasmine and Stardust tea. I really like their Silver Needle Jasmine tea, which is their white tea blended with jasmine flowers. It was really smooth and whimsical like Alice in the Wonderland. Their Stardust tea was okay. It was more on the fruity end and it's a gentle blend of blue lavender, cornflowers, blue mallow blossoms, rose petals, and lemongrass with a hint of lemon and mango.The staff was really nice. They were so attentive and patient even though we stayed way past closing..I used to come here as a little kid then came back recently. I was amazed to find everything the same. This truly is a New York classic. The scones are amazing. I actually don't even like scones from anywhere else. They are very dense and soft inside, and they come in unique flavors. The pumpkin scone is SO GOOD. It comes with a really good glaze on it, and the flavor is amazing. I highly recommend it. The tea was great as well, and they give a lot for the price. Everything comes in a really cute display with beautiful, spunky tea pots and cute tea cups. The food comes on 3-tiered cupcake stands. The interior of the restaurant is cozy and is a happy atmosphere. This was the perfect place to get warm after a cold winter walk in Central Park. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant..This place is a must see/do if you're in New York City. My friend has been telling me about it for years and we finally went there and it did not disappoint. It's so cute inside and I love the tea cups are all different. The scones were to die for and the tea was delicious. Service was excellent and we took their suggestions in the tea and we were very happy with the selection. We will definitely be back on our upcoming trip in November.It was a great experience with good customer service and good food. The interior was interesting too."
"This place's slices are pretty dull.  The pizza here (even the fresh pies) seems to never achieve a sufficient level of crispness; I usually cut the roof of my mouth trying to eat pizza from other restaurants (yes that's a good thing), but the pizza here doesn't have the same effect.  I come back only because I'm too lazy sometimes to walk all the way to 18th.  3 stars, because I haven't tasted any other items on the menu aside from the garlic knots..I ordered on grubhub and the pizza was awful. First when the  Delivery guy handed me the Box the Box was sagging if I didn't hold it from the bottom I felt like the pizzabox was going to fall out of my hand... And number 2 when I open the Box the pizza itself was soggy and it wasn't cut properly so I had to cut the pizza...the crust was soggy n chewy. Like eating wet rawhide. Never ordering again..I wouldn't even give this place a star. Hands down the nastiest pizzeria in the neighborhood. I was honestly scared to eat my lasagna. The meat was black and looked super old. Don't waste your time ordering from this place!"
"How is it possible to not love Subway's $5 footlong deals?  It's very cheap, $5 pays for two meals & [most] is good for you!  This particular Subway is a bit more hidden so you can't really tell that it is there until after you step under the construction roofs, but it is one of my favorites.  There are generally less people here during lunchtime since they are not as well-known and the staff members are friendly.  They always have their featured footlong of the month (unless it's ANYtober).  I especially look forward to when the meatball marinara, sweet onion chicken teriyaki & chicken parm sammiches are featured.  Those are my favorites..There's not too much to Subway restaurants. Let's be serious, they're jussi average at best for the food that they put out. Ain't nothing special, but you hope they actually don't mess up  your meal. The service was great here, the staff was friendly. Overall a good experience except for that one creepy old lady that kept staring at me.I mean subway is great, but the only reason I gave them a 3  is because of the lack of seating - especially being so close to a college. I saw like 4 people just come in not buying anything but just sitting there (and they only have about 8 seats total!).Tiny but convenient when you're trying to get to 23rd and 8th from 26th and 6th & the F isn't stopping at 23rd Street on the weekend.  It looks like this one has been remodeled and they assume you are carrying out when you put in an order.  The guy manning the counter went off to the back once customers left; I decided to eat inside since I'd not had lunch and had a big wheeled suitcase on me (came from a photo shoot).  It seems an employee or maybe the owner showed up while I was there since this guy with kids came in and got to go to the back.  It seems I was there when it was time for more workers to start since another woman came in before him and went to the back.  No one bothered me and I was the only person in there other than those people.  Either I hit the right time or maybe this place usually isn't crazy crowded?  Who knows but for a Subway, I've definitely experienced worse..Quick and easy you know the deal build your own sandwich, everything I wanted no problems. It was early like 11ish am so it was quite only two other people came and ordered to go while I sat in and ate . No problems . Easy . Cheap . And a nice healthier option then the $1 pizza / or burger spot / chipotles around the corner . It was just right size I got the $4 turkey sub made it a meal and carried on with my day and didn't feel like junk after ..The sandwiches were so good and when I go to subway my stomach hurts but this one doesn't I don't know what it is but it's SOO GOOD!!!!.Don't buy the soup unless you want to pay full price ($3.00) for half the bowl! Seems like the owner is a cheapskate and can't afford to give the full amount of soup that their suppose to serve!!..  Grrr, I'm flipping   STARVING! Flatiron  sucks!

There's no cheaplunch spots in the Flatiron Districtand SUBWAY LIES! $5 my ass..Subtember! All foot long subs in September are $5.This place got some seats, not bad. Pretty crowded I would say. I was a bit disappointed since all I had was an AMEX card on me. By the time it was time to pay, they didn't accept it. Good thing I was eating with my gf that has a Visa card on her.I mean a big franchise and you don't accept amex?I mean the B&B African place is a small local restaurant even accepts amex.get with the program!.What can I say?  It's your standard Subway, and it drew me in with the Februany promotion.As others have noted before me, the staff is friendly and the store is a bit hidden, but there's an overhead sign visible from 7th Avenue that points you to the entrance.  The sub I ended up getting was surprisingly small compared to the subs I've ordered from Subways in the last few years (I always get the same toppings), but that could just be based on the particular person who served me..Absolutely horrible customer service. Walked in around 9:30 am. Same rude subway rep behind the counter. But this time he was behind the counter texting on his phone. I said ""excuse me"" and he didn't bother looking back. His text must have been more important than assisting a customer. What a fucking jackass. Your job is simple and you can't even that. I'm a manager and I know what is expected with employees and that was totally unacceptable."
"After a lunch on a rainy day with a gf, I had drinks with a dear friend who I needed to talk to. He picked this place because he wanted to see the Bears play and he lived right next door. When I arrived, the Bucs already won so all I needed to do was drink and have a good time with my friend. I got my usual Tito's, soda and lime juice while he got beer beer beer. Our bartender was fantastic. He didn't do a shot with me, but he gave me a shot of Don Julio when I told him I have a long week coming ahead. K-Lawn (how you say it, not how you spell it) will make sure your glass is never less than half full. You end up drinking like a sailor. However, I had such a hard time getting drunk for some reason and kept requesting stronger drinks. A single became double and eventually I was just downing triples. Okay, so my friend got nachos. We saw a vegetarian guy get a vegetarian version and I was not amused. Where is the meat?! My friend got the vegetarian and added chicken and jalapenos. It was something else. Nothing fancy. Just chips, guac, chicken, beans, sour cream, onions, but wow! I said I'd have a few bites, I prob ate like a fourth. tI practically live at friend's place so this place will be solid if we want to go out, but not go out too far! See you soon K-Lawn!.It was n awesome place good people and good food the atmosphere was awesome I will definitely go back again.Waiting out a snowstorm here a week ago, the pints of Guinness were poured well by a lovely Irish lass, the burgers are solid with good pub fries, and the place is well worn. This was close to Penn Station, our hotel, and MSG. Surprisingly not as touristy as I would have thought given the locale... This is definitely more of the sports pub idea, but it was fine as Gotham received some Mother Nature Whoopass and we were basically stuck inside for a few hours. Actually very reasonable to eat and pickle the liver here as well..Was walking by this place they had a sign out front as shown in my picture that says happy hour 4 to 8... so I walk in and ask them if they have any shot specials they say no and then I ask them if they have any drink specials at all and they say abruptly ""no we don't drink specials on a Saturday evenings""It was 7:15 pm and sign said happy hour 4-8 i guess for them happy hour did not mean specials.Your average bar. They were nice enough to accommodate a group of 9 of us. We went out to watch the Chelsea/Madrid game. They had it on the big screen! Staff was very friendly. They took our temperature and conducted contact tracing. They have social distancing signage and the tables are spaced out..Nice Place, stopped in while visiting NY and walking around.  All the food hit the spot!.Hands down the best bangers and mash I've ever had. Everything was really good, but the gravy, oh my gosh. Damn good..The server was very attentive and quick. The food was what you would expect at a bar. I ordered a Celtic Burger which came with sautéed mushrooms, cheddar cheese and Irish bacon...with a side of fries. I  did also order a drink that was similar a Ginger mule but I didn't taste much ginger in it. They have bathrooms upstairs and a few no ore down stairs to avoid peeing your pants after throwing back too many beers. The crowd seem to be familiar and they had many Televisions playing various games, therefore it's the perfect feat spot to take in your sports favorite..This is the best sports bar in New York!!  Loved it.  Staff is fantastic!  Make sure this is a stop on your NYC visit..People who give bad reviews on Demsey are really missing the point. It's a no-frills Irish bar that doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It's a local spot in a megacity that might be the one few place that doesn't water down their alcohol. I came here for drinks before dinner. Then regrettably went to ""Legends"" to watch a Knick game, took a sip of their watered-down piss beer, and then came straight back to Demsey. Lol. For the price, service, and quality of a local bar Dempsey is my new go-to spot. Their food is a better quality Applebees but let's be real, you're not coming here for fine dining. You're coming here for good drinks, with good people, to have a good time. Try it out, if you hate it, your drinks on me. If you love it, leave a healthy tip."
"Let me tell you about the wonderful experience I had at this branch. If you're not in a ""feel good I wanna hear a nice story about staff at a fast food joint that typically carries a one or two star rating mood"" GO BACK! Abort reading this review. I ordered my fish sandwich and proceeded to the seating area. Side note: maybe it's all the branches now but this one seemed all high-tech as you can purchase your food from one of the self-service kiosks here. (I'd be afraid for my job if I was a cashier here). They also deliver via urber eats. Anyway as I was looking for a table, the staff member moping was so gracious with her ""oh no, you can pass, don't worry I'll mop it over"". I immediately connected with her energy, what a sweet spirit. You ever met someone like that? Their very presence puts you at ease and you kinda want to hug them but you don't know why? Only me? Okay. I didn't disrupt her cleaning but passed around and situated myself to enjoy my sandwich and free wifi. This is when I noticed the same staff member going to tables and speaking with customers. She approaced my table with ""how are you doing, everything okay?"" I was taken aback, at a fast food? Wow! Who is she? I thanked her and she said to me ""I'm Monique, if you need anything just call for me okay, that's why I'm here"".  **Stares after her**When I was finished with my meal Monique appeared again asking if she can take my trash away for me. Again, I thanked her but didn't want her to. I was so impressed with her behaviour that I pulled her into to a little chat. She's of Trinidad and Panamanian descent and she told me how much she loves her job (CLEARLY). Such pride, so much effort for what I'm sure isn't the big bucks, incredibly humbling experience. Ms. Monique if you're reading this, you deserve all the success and blessings the universe has for you, because it has! Your spirit I'm sure has touched many customers as it touched mine. Continue spreading that light and being a motivation for others. It's not what you do but how you do it. You my dear, you're a Yelp five star general! **Salute**The store was immaculately clean, service from other staff members was quick and good, my (healthy lol) fish sandwich nice.Of course I'll be back. Y'all better look out for my girl if you visit here. The End..Definitely would not return here. Staff members are so rude it's frustrating. I would give this McDonald's zero stars unfortunately you need to at least post one star to review..This location is hit or miss. Sometimes its tasty, sometimes its cold and dry. Sometimes the staff os friendly,, sometimes they are rude. Today it was the latter for both.  Cold burger and fries cooked in old oil. Ugh.... I hope the toaster oven can Revive it.. Last few visits it was pretty good.  Hopefully next time will be better..As of the second week in June the cooks at this place are done wearing masks. No thanks. Also NOT 24hrs as advertised..I wish I could give it 0 stars. This Mc Donalds is so damn Ghetto especially the Staff they have a nasty Attitude. I don't understand why they hire people with no Customer Service. I will definitely not be coming back to this one..My coffee machine broke down 2 days ago. Since then, I'm going every morning to buy my Latte at this location. I'm happy to see that this McDonald's is actually clean, well managed and the team is great and respectful. It's totally different from the location on Utica Av (really disappointed) I rather walk more to get my coffee at your McDonald's, just because of the service..they served me a raw burger with strands of someone's weave in it !!i was so sick from this.. that was effing disgusting.This McDonald's sucks,    The night staff likes to say ""we're closed"" instead of doing their simple job.     How are you closed it's 24hours.    I guess I went in the 25th hour..The worst McDonalds I ever went to in my life! Rude employees, because when I was in the drive thru. And the employee I guess had a attitude, So when I asked her what's wrong. If she had a attitude she started getting mad at me, As if I insulted her! Never coming back to this McDonald's until she gets fired..This is BY FAR BAR NONE WORST McDonalds I've ever ordered from.  The staff is very rude, and even confirmed my order before it arrived when I ordered through uber eats.  I tried to fix it and they turned me away.  I can't stand that type of in professionalism."
"Wham, Bam, thank you Sam, pool, drinks, juke, Jenny Poo is all you need !! Good snacks Great music Fabtabulous people Puppies galoreWhere you got to go ? Nowhere, So cone here and get it on !.Working Man's BarLet's be honest, this is a dump bar under a bridge.  Working class people that like to get drunk.  The place is pretty cool if you ask me.  The kind of place that is stuck in the 1980's, but the bartender was very nice to us and patrons started buying us drinks.  No food.  Thanks.I have tried to enjoy the Starlite on MacDonald and Ave J for the last several years. It is the closest bar to me, and I do my spur-of the moment drinking there. There's usually a friendly face eager to serve from their extremely limited offering, just enough obnoxious characters to make it homey, and I wonder why there is usually no more than a handful of people. It is the Saturday night before the Super Bowl, and this place, including the bartender, are among the most disgusting people I have been in a room with in a very long time.I can't imagine what the owner is thinking. If his strategy was to run a successful business, it 's not working. With strains of a song I admit I am not familiar with, "" fuck it like I tuck it "" playing repeatedly, it has attracted just a handful of the type I am not inclined to associate with.Both of the TV's are tuned to a sci-fi movie from the 90's- no mention of tomorrow's Super Bowl, a loud, obnoxious, woman behind the bar waving a remote shrieking, "" there's nothing to watch"".I should have listened to Mr Duran Dominguez and called Uber and gone to Denny's, where a nice sit down at the bar never disappoints.The owner of this establish ment should look at his tape from tonight- I so hope there is sound. It will answer any questions he might have about why no one is in this tiny spot that could be a gem.Got to go take a shower..Please don't come here - you will ruin it.Oh, Yelp won't let that one line be my review - well, too bad-that's it!Bye!.Stopped in for a Dewars.  It was cheap at $5.  Was a light pour and looked a little watered down so it was worth $5.  Fair and square.  Tipped the pretty russian bartender $1.  I guess she appreciated the tip because she started washing classes in front of me giving me a nice eyeful of her ample cleavage.  Merry Christmas!! There was an Orthodox Jew and a loudmouth in there besides me -- so it was a mixed crowd.  We all got along.  The waitress teased the loudmouth about trying to get him excited.  He took the bait and said that ""with the way you look honey, it wouldn't take much""  She thanked him, but said he should be careful or her bodyguard will take offense.  He's starts yelling ""you mean 'the Freak'?  I'm 65 and I know 'the Freak' since we were both 5 years old!"".  Well you get the idea, it's a cozy relaxed place.  I liked it there..A Chinese guy, an Orthodox Jew, and an old Italian guy walk into a bar......that's the starlite!  Truly an old school dive bar that's why I gave it the stars.  They don't need drink specials or happy hour because it's always cheap here.  Not a place to have your honeymoon date but for a very casual night with a few drinks and pool your in the right place..When I am not wearing a suit, I come here to unwind, relax and have a few drinks. No judgement, no bullies, no dress code... Just come as you are. Suck at pool? Play anyway, just don't scratch the table. Darts? Yes. Lotto and that game with the balls on the TV? Got that too. The restroom smells a little bit, buy hey: ""IT'S A RESTROOM IN A BAR!!!"" what do you want? The drinks are cheap and so are some of the women, but don't say that to them... They might hurt you if you do. If you want a fancy bar, go to Manhattan, if you want a place you can kick back, relax and have a few drinks... Come to The Starlite""..Best Bar in Brooklyn !! But Puffy you know this ! Drink specials are fantabulous. The super staff serves up the best atmosphere around. Fun games, Juke  and pool table. Puppy friendly and kittens are welcome on a case by case basis. Owls rule trivia night Monday ! There are hot chicks  Snacks galore compliments of the amazing Thursday night bar mistress Jenny Sue Lynn.Reasonably priced Tattoo Wednesday is heating up $20 ea 2 for $30 Cigar night is Two for Tuesday. Ladies night Thursday, bring the charm and beauty‍‍ ‍‍‍* CASH ONLY. TIP AT YOUR OWN RISK *.Not every bar need to be fancy, and serve crazy and expensive drinks. There are enough of those in Manhattan. And this spot is so special that either you like it or you won't. Old style bar, with a barman that doesn't try to make you like him with fake smiles. And if you want to drink for low price, this may be a good spot for you. It is small, located belle the subway, and looked a bit dark from outside, but I hate to read reviews from people who judge this place by comparing it to the shiny modern places. There are few characters there, I can tell you that, but they can make a great night, and make you constantly smile, or get over drunk, and you better head home....This place is a toilet of a bar that is needed in an area where you just can't get quick cheap drink. They also have a pool table.I love it"
"Still one of my favorite spots to go for a cheap beer, Alligator hasn't changed much in the years I've been coming. It was always the nicer of the two (RIP crocodile), with ample seating at the bar, booths up in front you don't really stick to, and a large back room. Oh, and yes, you still get a pizza ticket with every drink you buy, which is one hell of a deal*. I hesitate to call Alligator a dive because it's really not. Yes you can get a beer and a shot for 6$ if that's your thing, and yes they have cheap mix drinks, but it still doesn't quite check all the boxes off to be a dive (maybe a new age hipster dive?). Either way, the staff is always super chill, there's a pool table, and they do karaoke a few nights a week. TL;DR, pop off the L, grab a seat at the bar, and enjoy cheap liquor accompanied by surprisingly decent pizza with every drink you order. If that doesn't sound good to you, I'm really not sure we can be friends. _________________*Splurge 1$ for bacon, and for gods sake, tip the guy who makes your pie..So much fun and a great dive bar! I really wish there was a place like this by me in Philadelphia.The service was great and the inside was so cool. Karaoke, pool table, photo booth, tv everywhere playing sports and free pizza! Pizza was honestly not that good but it was free with a drink purchase! Pretty incredible and unique.Prices were great here! A ton of deals for a shot and beer combo. Such a fun place to check out and I'll definitely be back!.Affordable drinks (strong drinks), drink deals, karaoke, arcade games and  FREE pizza. This place has everything you want for a fun night out. Honestly the price point is so good I don't mind taking the 40 min drive here often. If you haven't you need to check this spot out. Good vibes all around!.ALLIGATOR LOUNGE IS SO MUCH FUN. If you like friendly staff, cheap drinks, complimentary pizza, and free karaoke, checking this dive bar out once is a must! I came here with my friends after they checked out another bar and concluded that was not it. This spot was highly recommended by a local & was a few doors down from where we were staying, so we had our drink on here! Bartenders were all super friendly, the pizza was perfect drunchies, the photobooth was fun, and I got to sing my ass off to Celine Dion. What more can you ask for?.Been going to this place for 10 years!!! Service has declined significantly. Rude & ignorant attitude from a lady bartender who is obviously new and a male bartender who dismisses his patrons trying to close out a tab to tip him. One bartender had the nerve to ask me and my friend for more TIP money because of his service. He was short of good hospitality with a distain look on his face as if he hated his job. I'm just saying if you can't be NICE or Friendly get out the hospitality business altogether.Was so excited to go here for karaoke night but left so disappointed. The bouncers were extremely nice and truthfully were the highlight of the experience. We went solely for the karaoke and left so upset. The MC was SO rude and talked down to my friend & I (both females) yet did not say anything to the males we were with. He spoke to us as if we were young children or were drunk, which, neither were the case. When I told him I did not live in New York & had never been to this bar/karaoke night so I did not know how it worked, he replied, ""That's not an excuse. Do you know how to read?"" It was extremely upsetting as he got ticked off by us even asking how we could access the song list and had a nasty attitude. We told the bartenders about his disgusting behaviors but I wish we would have spoken to someone else. Wont step foot here again because of the atmosphere the MC provided..This place is as good as dive bars can get. I was quite pleasantly surprised that I had a blast considering that this place is located in Brooklyn! I'm not clear on how accessible by public transportation this location is, since we drove, but if you find yourself in the area, stop in.It looks small from the outside until you realize there are several sections.  Upon entry, after getting carded, you see the bar to the right and a number of seats/booths to the left. Keep walking and you'll run into the billiards table across from the pizza section.  Walk past that and you will find the bathrooms followed by the karaoke room filled with a stage and screen.It really has a bit of fun for everyone.  The clientele is diverse and the atmosphere is relaxed. The bathroom is divey, and the line for it gets long so plan accordingly.  Drinks are inexpensive and they have a number of beers on tap. With each drink purchase you earn a ticket that is redeemable for a personal pizza which helps to keep your night going. I was in great company which surely made this place extra fun. However, this place would also be fun on your own as everyone, staff included, was approachable and friendly..This place is on the money. Nice atmosphere the bartender's a nice the patrons there are nice. I do like when they have trivia night there. The karaoke scene in the back is very inviting a great crowd to want to hang your hat.I just wish the pool table was a little bigger.Make sure you also tip your pizza guy when you get a free pizza.Definitely recommend that place to anyone who wants to have a great time..HAD A GREAT TIME HERE!!!!! So glad I found this spot while looking for bars in the area with good music & a good vibe.FREE pizza with every drink purchase. Where they do that at? HERE!If you want toppings it's $1 per topping - super cheap. Drinks, vibe, pool table, music & pizza was good! I can truthfully say I enjoyed my Friday night here..The drink I got was pretty good and not too expensive but we went for the karaoke that's advertised on their website and there wasn't karaoke or any explanation of why"
"Cute and convenient coffee shop on Columbia's campus .Staff is super friendly . They have a few bakery items , water and some Joe branded items for sale also ..Spacious and quiet, perfect place to study or work! It's a little hidden but you'll spot it by its glass windows. Decided to stop by because the library opens at 12pm on the weekend; glad I found this spot. I got an iced coffee with almond milk and it was very smooth..I've come here several times. I find it kind of pricey for coffee, but offers a medium-sized selection of drinks. This Joe Coffee Company is on Columbia's campus. I ordered their turmeric latte and thought it was okay. They have a lot of tables for students to study or hang out at..The ""hidden"" Joe Coffee, when Northwest Corner Build Joe becomes too full. A little expensive as coffee goes, but not as bad as it can be and very delicious. I'm a big fan of grabbing a cappuccino and a salted chocolate chip cookie and hanging on the steps outside the building if the tables are full. The line can get long in the middle of the day or during finals, but its a welcomed break from the other coffee shops on campus!.It's certainly the cleanest spot on campus. This very nice man spraying a million squirts of cleaner all over every surface is...thorough. Once the mist of Windex clears, I'm sure my chai latte with taste just as sweet. And Joe's does a good job of hiring. Their people are pretty much uniformly amiable. I'm all for Joe's March across the Upper West Side.Give my friend cleaning the place something else to do. The place is SPOTLESS. (What happened to cleaning businesses and office at night? That used to be a thinking.).Cozy place with an excellent coffee. I've ordered a ""cafe au laite"" om a big mug (how it has to be) and it was excellent"
"This is a great diner. It's has a typical diner menu.  I ordered  my favorite diner food,  liver and onions. I  do not like my liver over cooked and dry. They cooked it just right.  The hash browns were very good, along with the Manhattan chowder. Vegetable were okay. Service was quick and efficient.  Restroom was clean.  If you in the area , it a place to get good diner food..Way overly priced for sub par food.Coffee is terrible, French toast was ok but under cooked. Eggs Benedict had little taste. Chipped beef terrible from a can.Go to the bagel joint across the street from it..Cosmic Diner is a traditional New York diner on 8th Avenue in the upper theater district. I made my first visit yesterday when my girlfriend and I came in for brunch at around 11 AM. The place was packed, and we were fourth in line. Fortunately the turnover rate is very high and we were soon seated at a table. I ordered the lumberjack waffle platter: one plain waffle, two eggs, breakfast meat of choice. The waffle was warm with a firm exterior and a soft inside. The eggs were over medium as desired, and I counted five strips of greasy bacon (two were stuck together). All told it was an adequate meal, but not as filling as I'd expected. My girlfriend selected the western omelette with home fries and wheat toast. I got to try a few bites. The omelette was huge and normal, so plain as to be almost tasteless. No cheese, either; perhaps you can request that? The home fries were very disappointing, basically just fried hash browns with little substance. The toast, however, was perfect for dabbing up the yolks of my eggs. The food was basic enough, but ranged from blasé to disappointing. Perhaps that's normal, but the prices ($20/plate on average) had led me to expect more. There's comfort in knowing what to expect from diner food, and you can't ask for too much..On Sunday my cousin and I were looking for a place to have breakfast. This diner happened to be right around the corner from her hotel. With restaurant seating being limited or by reservation only I was glad we were able to get seated right away. However that was the only good thing about this diner. The food was basic diner fare. Not bad but not good either. The grits looked like rice. If you've had grits before then you know the texture should be smooth, kinda like porridge. The service wasn't the best either.I felt pressure from the waiter to order immediately. Also the waiters move so fast that they don't realize or maybe they do realize but they basically snatch the menu out of your hands. Last but not least when restaurants are supposed to be operating cashless due to the pandemic this place charges a 4% fee when you use a credit card. I understand restaurants have been struggling but to pass this fee off to the customer is unacceptable. It's located near Time Square so I'll most likely never return. The food and the fees aren't worth the trip..Pretty good diner, centrally located near Times Square. I ordered the eggs Benedict. It was very good. My wife and mom ordered more standard breakfasts, like pancakes and eggs. There was a bit of a wait to get seated but it wasn't too bad. Overall experience was 4/5..We have always ordered from cosmic diner at work. It's always been fine... No complaints other than we could always use more condiments for our large work orders. My husband and I decided to order today from our home. The phone number listed on cosmic diner's website is apparently a 3rd Party, Grubhub. My order was incorrect. I called again the number listed on the website and just made note that my order was incorrect. This third party kindly offered apologies and said they would like to compensate for the mistake. Not long after I hung up, cosmic diner's Melanie calls me with an incredibly rude attitude and says my order wasn't incorrect and if I thought it was, to Never order from there again. To which her wish will be granted. And to Melanie, I wish for you to find more joy and kindness. Blessings..I went here for a quick brunch.  The service was fast and the food came out fast as well.  I ordered the chicken panini melt which cost about $20 and came with fries.  The portion was nice and large though the sandwich had no flavor.  The panini had chicken, cheese, and spinach.  The chicken was cooked well but had no flavor.  I think this place is fine if you need something quick but it was generally okay on food.  Make sure you bring cash to pay since they charge 4% for using credit cards..Came here for breakfast. Staff was super friendly, service was great, food came out within mins of ordering.. not sure how they were able to do that so quickly but we weren't complaining! Would def come back..We were a party of 9 (6 adults, 3 kids).  We were surprised to walk in and be seated right away.  The food was good, prices were what you'd expect for area.  The staff were accommodating for changes requested to dishes.  The portions were big..Good service and the food is acceptable. Female Cashier is not customer-friendly unfortunately, or else this is a 4 to 5 star spot in the neighborhood!"
"I recently ate at Las Ramblas, which is on West 4th Street near 6th Avenue. We truly enjoyed this very tiny place. Great neighborhood hole in the wall really cramped but they have great tapas and sangria. The menu is all tapas, some cold and some hot and they also offer specials each day. We had the duck sausage on a skewer with quail eggs (banderillas con chirizo de pato); bocadillos crujientes; shrimp in an amazing garlic sauce; grilled sardines (amazing); patatas bravas; albondigas; and something else I can't remember (sorry!)They do not take reservations, it is a very small place that fills up quickly! Would definitely go back! What not to like? Fun tapas, great prices, yummy sangria and a very polite staff. By the way, the small bathroom is really cute!Don't judge the amount of food (I like to eat LOL!!). No; really, portions are small, and we were a party of 3 hungry ladies ahahahaFood-Banderillas con chorizo de pato : duck sausage on a skewer with quail eggs, pimento and pearl onionCroquetas de Jamon: york & serrano ham croquettesPatatas bravas: potatoes w/ smoked pimentón & aioliBocadillos Crujientes: crispy mini sandwiches of york ham, mahon cheese, & piquillo peppersAlbondigas: roasted meatballs w/garlic, manchego cheese, & lemon-oregano dressingGambas San Martin: shrimp in an amazing garlic, white wine & lemon sauceSardinas en Escabeche: grilled sardines over marinated peppers & onions (amazing).Had the best NYE meal here! The staff and owner were so incredibly warm and welcoming. We were greeted with NYE necklaces and hats and complimentary champagne. Additionally, they gave us 12 grapes to celebrate the Spanish New Year which was so much fun. We ordered the following dishes:- Meat and cheese platter- Patatas Bravas- Vegetable Paella (special)- Gambas San Martin- Pomegranate SangriaOverall, food was solid, but the paella and shrimp could have used more seasoning. The sangria was tasty but was a bit on the watery side. Moreover, if you have a party of more than 4 people, this place may be a bit cramped. Nonetheless, the atmosphere and service was so amazing, and it was still a 5 star experience..This was a so-so tapas experience. The strawberry sangria was very tasty but the food was just okay. The flavors were not that intense and everything was very buttered up. I liked the cozy feel of the restaurant and fast service. Our food came out pretty quickly.I tried:-Sparkling Strawberry -Chipirones Fritos (calamari)-Banderillas Con Chorizo De Pato (duck sausage skewers)-Langistinos (prawns)-SpinachAll the dishes came out at the same time and they were nothing to write home about. I was still hungry at the end of our meal.When I came in to ask for a table the staff seemed flustered and gave me a 25 minute wait time. Shortly after, a couple came in after me and was also given the same time but then seated before me..I lived in Spain for a year, so I am fairly familiar with Spanish cuisine. I think Las Ramblas was solid Spanish food and reminded me of many places we went while living in Madrid.We ended up ordering a ton of food and shared the croquetas de jamón, chicken empanadas, sautéed wild mushrooms, meatballs, grilled octopus, and patatas bravas. Everything was very solid and had a nice flavor. The only thing I did not care for was the octopus; it did not have much flavor and the texture was not quite right. Overall, I mostly enjoyed Las Ramblas and would go back!.I've sadly not gone to many Spanish restaurants since actually visiting Barcelona and dining at the touristy strip known as Las Ramblas that lends its name to this tapas and wine bar.But the memories all came rushing back. The restaurant is cozy, with a decent number of tables (but very close together).Their wine selection is excellent, separated by region. Lots of price points, and they have a few by the glass as well.In terms of food, only tried a handful of things. The gambas (tail-on shrimp) was excellent. Keep the sauce to dip your bread in!Their meat charcuterie platter was the star of the night though. Jamon iberico, two types of chorizo, and a few other meats. The morcilla (blood sausage) was my favorite.Also had the boquerones (cold anchovies in oil), which was fine. As well as the olives, which were.. olives.If I had to dock them a star for something, it would be that they kept moving us around. I started at the bar because I was waiting for a friend. Then they moved us to a 2-top (without asking us). We told them we would eventually be 3, and asked if we could move to a bigger table, and they just said they would do that when the third person was there. The table they offered us was taken by then (place was getting busy), so they moved us to the high top by the door. Like literally at the door. Not enough room to pull the table out because the door would hit it. Not the best place, but the food and wine more than made up for it..Five stars for the service and the outdoor dining atmosphere, one star for the drinks, two stars for the food and value.  Extremely friendly, attentive service is what saved this experience.  Team is willing to assist in making menu choices, and everyone goes out of their way without being intrusive.Honestly speaking, their margaritas were watered down and unbalanced in flavor, same can be said for the sangria - it was difficult to taste the ingredients within the Spanish standard.  I will say though that the portion size of the cocktails was good.Sadly the portions for the food were way off - yes, tapas is small plates, but five quarter-sized meatballs for $12 was not reflective of value, and the Spanish meatballs were dense and unflavorful, though the sauce it came in was a major winner.   The chorizo was flavorful and delicious, but again, portion size was not reflective of the $10 price.Bottom line is the service was good to bring me back for another attempt, but I will try some different foods next time and maybe stick to a Spanish beer..Came in Wednesday at around 7pm and got seating right away.Service was phenomenal. The waiter was very friendly, made a great suggestion on a dish... A bold move for any one to make when it comes to food that you $$ for ,  And... More importantly.... They were not stingy with the extra bread.I ordered gamba, the pulpo .. As recommended by our waiter.., and batatas. Everything was delicious! The gamba's broth was my favorite flavor of all the dishes I ordered. Be sure to stockpile the bread at the table for dunking in that sauuuce.The pulpo tasted very fresh and batatas .. Which were drizzled in some cream sauce... Were just as good. If you are in the area I highly recommend you stop by and eat here. The place is a little on the small side.. I think I just got lucky with my seating situation ... Buuuut for this price point .. You are gonna have a hard time competing with this experience..Cramped place but really good tapas. The chicken empanadas and dense with some flavorful filling. The veggie tapas with mushroom and peppers is deliciousness! We also tried another veggie tapas with cheese mushroom and potatoes it was a bit too cheesy and salty for my taste.Only major disappointment was the sangria , watery! couldn't feel the alcohol at all..We came with a reservation for 5, not knowing how uncomfortably small this restaurant was. It was so small that we had to move the table just so other diners could get up from their seat throughout the night. The food and service were decent, but I wouldn't at all recommend coming here with a larger group, as it will not be comfortable..While on a speak easy hopping sort of a night, we stumbled upon this cute little West Village tapas place. The Gambas San Martin was the highlight of the night. The shrimp was fresh and the sauce was really flavorful. We also ordered the duck sausage skewers and the cheese plate. The cheese plate came with a lightly sweet and really fresh honey. We also got the red pear sangria which tasted watered down. The place was quite empty for a Friday night."
"These guys  are really slow. When my best friend lived right downstairs from them Id sleep over, wake up early the following day to bring back some coffee for us. I would go with the intentions of it being a surprise, but i would always be gone for so long that I would never get back on time and end up having her homemade coffee and two ice coffees that i bought. I really cant think of anything else to say because the service here is not what it should be. They dont even act like they like being there. they make you feel like you are a major inconvenience being a patron to their store. I thought that having customers was all part of that whole money making thing?.Stale donuts. My french crueller was awful and old. So old it cracked into pieces. A cup of tea 2 french cruellers and a stale jelly donut. 10.00 into the trash..This morning I got coffee and breakfast from Dunkin' from this location and guess what there was rat  poop  in it. I threw up like 5 times after tasting that SH.... I feel sick don't buy anything from them!!!.A older Indian or middle male named Sharif  that is the boss there personally insulted me for not having a mask  on.  I have personal health issues that doesn't allow me to wear one. He didn't ask. He right away started to insult me and my character in front of his employees and the other customers that were more than 6 feet away from me.  He was very aggressive and disrespectful..The Dunkin at the location of 116th and metropolitan avenue. They charged me $2.93 for a bottle of 16 oz Diet Coke. When I asked him (his name was Sharf) why it was so expensive. He didn't answer.I walked out and walked back in wanting a refund.He looked at me like I drank it already, tested the bottle and gave me a real hard time.He started saying ""don't blame me, don't blame me"" he got loud with me when I replied ""the price is way too high"". He then started muttering under his breath and made sure that he knew that I was supposedly wrong for doing this.I've never been yelled at before for wanting an immediate refund.Plus price gouging people during a pandemic. The average price of Diet Coke in a New York store is $1.50 to 2 dollars. I was annoyed, the fact that I was being yelled at by the guy while simply making a transaction is unacceptable. With a yelp rating of 1.5 out of five stars you would think they would care a little more to make their customers happy. I guess I am going to have to follow suit and do the same by giving them 1 star. Besides the fact that the place was rather dirty as It always is. I will NOT return to this location again..Staff is nice and friendly, however I don't recommend using the DD App to pre-order your food. They seem to be out of things quiet often. When you arrive they say they don't have it and you walk out empty handed. No refund provided. You would have to go through the app and trying to get a refund though the app is a nightmare..The employees at this location are very rude and make orders incorrectly a staggering percentage of the time. This bothers me primarily because a) they express verbal annoyance and seem to disbelieve allergies and intolerances and b) they become passively aggressive or verbally aggressive with patrons when corrected. I have seen them argue with an older woman who ordered a very simple but expensive drink and they gave her something completely random and bizarre. She said it was wasn't what she had ordered and I watched them berate her over wanting the drink she had ordered for 15 minutes. They've done similar things to me, often threatening my lifelong vegetarianism by putting bacon in breakfast sandwiches I order and always being so nasty about making mistakes. There are one or two good employees, don't get me wrong. Overall, very poor safety practices (always full of flies and wiping noses before touching food). Even though it is a 2 mile round trip versus a 2 minute walk, I always will take the trek to Starbucks instead..This location is AWFUL.  Bagels are always hard.  Simply--They should NOT be selling old bagels..Really bad...-Gets orders wrong a lot-Food is not good-Staff tries hard but the foundation is very off-Looking forward to a Starbucks opening some day!.Really bad...-Gets orders wrong a lot-Food is not good-Staff tries hard but the foundation is very off-Looking forward to a Starbucks opening some day!.My wife stopped by dunkin yesterday. It took 2-3 mins for the guy in the back to even notice anyone waiting. He slowly roams up and doesn't say a word. The muffin she received was rock hard. Fast forward to today. We stopped by to get a beverage. She noticed the same two muffins sitting in the tray as she saw yesterday. Nice to see how fresh everything is...."
"Excellent spot. Great music. The layout is tight... sofas, mirrors, drapes... and the colors... all put together set a great mood. Gets crowded but you won't even notice cause you will be having a great time. The only problem is finding the place :-) Its on the NW corner of 8th and 16th street. Unless there is a line you will walk right past it and when you finally notice it, you won't even think its the place. Drinks are reasonably priced. My night included 4 shots, 4 mixed, 2 glasses of wine, 2 bottles of water for $114. So go an enjoy it. If you are single and want to mingle this is an excellent spot. If you have a special someone TAKE THEM WITH YOU cause otherwise you can get into trouble with the talent at this place..Imagine some sort of modern Victorian bar, with large mirrors and plush sofas, made all the more sexy by the red toned walls. Come to think of it, it's sort of got a bordello feel to it, and that's a compliment.One of the big gimmicks here are the hologram hotties who project from the ceiling - pretty cool I have to say - but the place packs it in with enough celebs and their look-alikes that you don't really need imaginary ones!.Sexy people..... stems to the ceiling and piercing eyes..... but this is really more of a pre party scene before ""going out"""
"A typical sport bar in the airport.  Nothing too great, nothing too bad.  Overpriced, as expected.  Mediocre food.I had the mexican salad, with added grilled chicken.  The chicken was pretty tasty, and the greens tasted fresh.  Spicy due to the jalapenos.  My bloody mary was okay, but missing that 'kick.'  I really don't want to be at this restaurant.  Or this airport.   I am a little lost girl stranded at the airport.  So I needed a big girl drink."

"Staff was great! Big big big shoutout to Chris at reception / front desk for making our first time in NY very enjoyable. He gave us tips on the ins and outs of NY and we were able to manage amazingly well given his advice! Super grateful for his help and the team at Sheraton should be thankful they an employee like him that goes above and beyond.My favorite thing about the hotel was the location, lobby, and fitness centers! Their fitness center is fully equipped with a ton of cardio and weight machines as well as towels, headphones, and water.Unfortunately, I have to take away 1 star because the bathrooms at this hotel needs some serious renovations. The paints were chipping, there were tons of dust and the caulking was coming off. Moreover, I didn't like that the hotel charges $25 for a mini fridge when it should be included with the stay.Overall, because of the great staff, location, and amenities of the hotel, I will definitely come back given the cons..Waterproof protective cover on mattress and light weight bedding made for a restless and uncomfortable night.Followed up by brown water flowing from the shower.Near impossible to get an answer from guest services when called.Room service closes at 11 and no way to order next day breakfast in advance.I will never stay here again. Huge disappointment..This is not the nicest hotel but serves its purpose. The rooms are small but but clean. The refrigerator did not work in our room and there' were signs of poor Sheetrock repair work and other general war and tear. The location is great a handful of blocks from Times Square, 5th Avenue, and Central Park. Great location for exploring. The price was right in line with the lodgings and seemed to be in line with other New York hotels.The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived early in the morning off a red eye and were given a room swiftly..This hotel is very conveniently located to walk to key destinations:Time Square - 10-12 minutesSubway- around the cornerCentral Park - 10 minutesPark Ave - 5 minutesBroadway- 5 minutesGreat restaurants La Grand Boucherie- across the streetyelp.to/3hRBWtcjWfbGR Souvlakia Straight up no nonsense Greek3 minutes walk on 56thsouvlakigr.comShake ShakeAcross the streetRockerfeller center Radio City Hall 5 minutes Hotel Room- yes! We had nice clean sheets, fluffy pillows, and good bed to lie in. We loved the TV tray next to our bed for extra convenience.Security is good at the hotel. There are always patrol officers around.The only thing we didn't like during weekend, a prom or something was going on and the young teens were yelling snd running in the halls as well as room next door. Elevators during peak time are a challenge to get out from your floor. Waited ten minutes to get to the lobby. Very good location and service!.We had a great experience here. Everything was super nice and clean. We loved having the view of Times Square from our window and how close it was to everything..I'm super happy to finally get a new layover hotel in Midtown, New York, after our erstwhile airline hotel closed due to Covid. The Sheraton New York Times Square is in a perfect spot and central to everything touristy to do in NYC. Left and right, forward and back, there are things to do around the hotel.The hotel is very tall and full of people. Check in process was smooth although it's hard to hear the front desk agent talk due to the hotel being crowded and the acetates surrounding the desk for Covid protection. I like how the room keys direct you to which elevator car to take! I got to my room and it's decently sized. However, it's still the usual Sheraton classic look and has not been modernized. However, Sheraton beds are always perfectly comfortable. Would prefer the modern Sheraton though. There is no fridge in the room and would need to call front desk to request for one.The gym is so nice! Very spacious with a separate cardio and weights area and fully loaded with Peloton bikes!!!  You have to sign in when you get in and provide your vaccination card.The lobby area has a bar as well called Library Bar.Overall I like the hotel due to the perfect location. You can't just stay in the room anyways being in New York and being in an area that is so upbeat and alive! Staff is accommodating and I also love that they have a Starbucks too at the lobby area..I was staying at the Sheraton in Times Square for an event I was working. I had my son, my puppy, and my husband with me. I wouldn't have chosen this hotel myself, but rather it was the hosting hotel for the event that I was working. Having stayed in the Times Square area many times at several different hotels, I was definitely expecting a small room. The room smelled like cigarettes and someone had used a ton of cleaning supplies to cover the smell. Neither good for the baby. I had told the front desk. They said a manager would call me. This room that we had, was the smallest room I've ever seen. The fact that we were even able to survive for two nights and three days with all of us crammed into that one room, is beyond me. As a platinum ambassador, which is the highest status that Marriott offers, I thought I would receive an upgrade for a better or somewhat bigger room as I know my colleague did. That was disappointing. However, I was very happy that it was pet friendly. That's a hard thing to come by with hotels. Only problem is, there's really nowhere to bring your animal for relief. I did like they didn't have to charge us any fee for that, though. Some hotels really whack you with some hefty fees while they provide no animal relief area. I didn't truly get a chance to walk around the hotel property because I was so busy with work. What I will say, is that the elevator situation was awful. They were at maximum capacity with several events happening all at once, and it took so long to get anywhere. It actually scared me because we were on a higher floor and I had my son with me. There's no way that we can take the stairs with a stroller. There was one point where the elevator message actually read ""no lift available. "" we waited 15 minutes then had to call down and tell them to send an elevator up because we had our son. It was definitely a stressful situation. There is a grab and go market open for breakfast and lunch and then at night it turns into a small restaurant and bar area. I believe it's called ""the library bar."" We got cocktails there one evening but no food. They don't allow outside food. One night, my husband and I wanted to order pizza and take it in and enjoy watching the game, but they would not allow us to. The price is very low to stay here considering it is a New York City hotel, and I believe that's why it was so crowded. If ever back in the area, I will not be choosing this location specifically because of the elevator situation. It is, however a good location if you're planning on enjoying the time Square area. It's just a few blocks away and walking distance from times square and Central Park..This hotel is so bad it's actually kind of comical. If you want the previous guest's pubic hair to get on you while showering, be talked to in a consistently condescending manner, and have almost no amenities at all, ALL while being charged the price of a designer purse, then this is a great place to stay! If you have a modicum of self-respect then I would book at one of the other many beautiful hotels in NY which I've enjoyed staying at in the past. The location isn't worth it and the Subway is a fantastic and easy way to get around. After our red eye flight I immediately took a shower after we checked in and noticed there were small curly black hairs (probably originating from the previous guest's nether regions) literally everywhere. One of them got on me in the shower!!  Very traumatizing start to our stay. They switched us to a different room which still had black hairs all over the sink! Either these rooms are being cleaned by Chewbacca or they're not cleaning them at all, and over covid that's a scary thought. Also the tub didn't drain in either room so enjoy standing in a foot of your own dirty bath water while you shower.  They've made some serious cuts ""due to covid"" that actually seem to have been done because of pure laziness rather than because of covid. They've shut down room service ""because of covid"" and said we can eat at Starbucks downstairs--but they've also shut down the entire downstairs seating area ""because of covid"" so there's nowhere to sit and eat your food if you do go there, even though indoor dining is open in the entire city. In fact, there's nowhere to sit downstairs at ALL if you want an escape from your dirty storage container of a room for a couple of minutes. Since there's no room service, good luck buying your own food because their mini fridges are all locked ""due to covid"". They can deliver a mini-fridge upon request, but the one they delivered froze all of our food completely solid which is great for preservation but not so great for consumption. There also aren't any utensils in the room at all and when we requested some they said they didn't have any. We ended up having to eat out three meals a day for the entire time we were here since they didn't supply an ice pick for our frozen mini-fridge food (now unusable food that we had already spent a bunch of money on)--time-consuming, expensive, and not great for those traveling on business. No microwave or any way to reheat food. The lobby bathroom is shut down ""due to covid"" and don't you dare ask about it because the condescension is palpable whenever you talk to the front desk about anything.Whenever you make a request, the person you make the request to does their utmost best effort to pass on the task to somebody else before resigning themselves to actually helping you. For example: asking for a band-aid, I get transferred to security, who then tells me to walk downstairs and grab it from the front desk who I had just talked to. All of this accomplished while talking to me in a tone of voice that sounds like I asked them to sacrifice their first-born child. I worked front desk for four years at multiple nice hotels all throughout college and I can tell you that the bad ratings this place has are well-deserved, it takes some serious effort to have customer service this bad. The bad reviews ALL say the same thing. But just in case management starts caring again: if you guys need some references for people who actually enjoy this line of work hit me up! I no longer work in hospitality but if I snatched someone off of the street I guarantee you they'd be better than most of the people you currently employ. Pros: if you're an Arctic explorer who somehow ended up in NY, you can store your ice samples in their mini fridges. You may also be lucky enough to get a glimpse of Chewbacca while he cleans your room. If your mom says your ego is too large then this is a also great place to go to get a good dose of snide remarks and condescension that will bring you down to earth again. Cons: everything else..had a great stay here! location is perfect (broadway, the theatre district, 42nd street) lobby and elevator service had a great gatsby vibe to it. great restaurant and fitness center. Starbucks in house. front desk concierge service was friendly. had a mini bar issue that they promptly fixed for me..1. Worst front desk clerks - Most unfriendly and unprofessional front desk that I have ever met. When you ask them anything they will roll their eyes with bad attitude to give you a wrong answer. I recommend Sheraton to give the front desk clerk, Debbie and Max, a more professional training about how to serve their customers. 2. Don't trust the room photo in hotel website - If there is sofa and table in the photo and you don't have them in your room? You can't argue it because they could remove it anytime to do a flexible adjustment. 3. Unclear, Old, and super Tiny room - During COVID-19 pandemics I thought hotel would make sure every room is clean and sanitize well. You could find other's hair in tub, sleep with torn bed sheet and there is dust everywhere behind the curtain. The stand lamp is old and keep swinging.4. Bar staff sometimes takes off their mask to make drinks for customers while they are talking. I don't think it is professional to make drinks with no mask and keep talking during pandemic. 5. The only good thing I want to say is cleaning staffs are very friendly not like front desk staff."

"was looking for quality French food for dinner and found the perfect spot! another gem found thanks to Yelp! on the outside, I never wouldve guessed there'd be some amazing food served in there but so glad we ate here! everything was perfectly prepared and my bf and I left very happy & satisfied! we even talked to the couple next to us who also loved their meal!the servers were super friendly and personable. it felt very relaxed in there and even though the tables are quite close to each other, we were still able to carry on our normal conversations. would recommend and definitely would come back here!.Cute old little place that brings back so many good memories. So nostalgic to have brunch here. I loved how it looked, felt, and tasted the same after all the years. Prix fix brunch was a total steal. I we also got the crème brûlée for dessert. It was textbook good. Exactly how you would make it if you make it straight from a French cookbook. Nothing hipster or extra; just simple and good French food. I would save room for the crème brûlée. It was really really good. I had the eggs Benedict with cured salmon and spinach omelette with goat cheese. They were both very good. They came with a side of fries and salad. Both were yummy and solid. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. It wasn't crowded on super bowl Sunday. I can imagine it would be busy if it weren't for that reason. I also like how there's soft French music playing in the background. The sound was perfect and enjoyable. Everything about this place reminds me of being in Paris. Will be back for dinner again soon..Very cozy neighborhood spot. Mussels weren't amazing but were good. Very good wine..Small intimate bistro with attentive service and sublime cuisine. We started with the delicious jumbo grilled shrimp paired with garlic mashed potatoes. Continuing, we had the salmon with green beans and the trout on a superb bed of sautéed spinach, walnut, carrots and lentils. We ended the meal with a delightful crepe suzette..Such a hidden gem in the city!! They are so authentic and have such good food & drinks. I know they get busy during prime lunch/dinner time so make sure to reserve beforehand! First of all, their sangria is sooo good. And all their dishes were SO well seasoned and we all enjoyed our dishes! Servers are attentive and so friendly. Honestly, no complaints here.Definitely keeping this place bookmarked for date nights and girls' night outs!!.I quite enjoyed my dinner here this evening with the girlfriend & our buddy who fancies himself a foodie & has an affinity for escargot & roasted chicken.  The girlfriend suggested coming here because of the wonderful reviews for these 2 dishes.  But of course I thought all the dishes we had this evening were delicious:  the pork chop, mussels and frites.  We made reservation to ensure we had a table which i am glad we did because it was a full house & that is a good sign.  The service was great & very attentive.  I thought the prices are very reasonable for this area & hope to have the chance to return for lunch soon..My boyfriend and I dined here on a Saturday morning. Most parties sat outside but we were inside. The portions were great for the prices, the service was friendly, and our orders came out very quickly. They played quiet jazzy guitar instrumentalmusic in the background so that contributed to the cozy slow Saturday brunch vibe we were looking for. I'd definitely like to check out this restaurant for their happy hour! We got their Eggs Benedict and the Eggwhite Omelette, both a 6 or 7/10, and included endless black coffee, always my favorite part of brunch!.Great spot for brunch. We sat outside where they built a nice semi enclosed structure. The brunch menu is great. The french toast and omelette were delicious. The egg dishes come with fries and salad. Coffee is also included. Check in on Yelp to use the brunch coupon. Great service..The food was delicious...the dishes were smart and unique, fresh and comforting. The service was impeccable....not many places in New York you don't feel super rushed!.Be prepared for overwhelmed staff at weekend brunch, especially if you're seated outdoors. While it's a plus that this place is packed on weekends, it also means the hosts/servers are streeeessssed. My friend arrived before me and tried to get check in first, and a server snapped at her to wait until I got there. Then she was ignored until I arrived--then we were both ignored for another 10 min before we could finally check in.Foodwise, this classic French-American fare. I got the Pappardelle Pasta with fries, and she got an omelette. We had copious amounts of rose, and perhaps that's why the service seemed better by the end."

"Been here a week and ate three time here.  Soups are ok tasting, but still god expensive.  Had a soda every time $4 but it is bottomless. So it is ok..This place's foods are pricy, but it is in Lincoln Center.  The foods are ok. I have eaten here a few time over the years.I have soup today.  It was nothing fancy and god expensive, but I needed hot liquid.  It is ok for Manhatten..Revamping this place was a total failure - absolutely not what Lincoln Center deserves! Sure, it was overpriced before as well, just like any other tourist trap in the area, but at least you weren't forced to share a table with strangers or sit awkwardly at a high table looking down at the people sitting in front of you. Previously, there were at least some remnants of a classy dining atmosphere, now this is nothing but a glorified food court. And the portions are as sorry as the design is dysfunctional. Calling a 1/4 of boiled cauliflower with watered down buffalo sauce and a blue cheese cream where you have to search for the actual blue cheese in a dish is a joke. To complete the insult, it's served with just a couple of a old & dry raw carrots and celery cuttings on the side. Too bad, this great location could do so much better with a decent bistro style restaurant ....Last resort cafe/restaurant because there are really so few choices around Lincoln Center.It's certainly convenient before a concert but it is way overpriced and the coffee is only the awful tasting Nespresso.Having been the previous version--American Table--I can confidently say this is an ambitious but failed attempt at creating something relevant to and for Lincoln Center.The number of tables have been stupidly reduced in favor of large, picnic-like monstrosities for four people each. I saw few parties of four. I'm confident couples occupy nearly all of the clientele. Trying to appeal to young people? Try creating great food like the previous version. This latest opus is tasteless, generic and over-priced. Gone are the brilliant sandwiches, savory soups and monster salads.  Now we have anemic portions of cauliflower and hummus nanobowls that appear to have been applied with a putty knife. No bueno. I'm sure the designer is proud of creating this faux minimalist environment but it's difficult to see it being successful. People want beautiful, elegant, great-tasting culinary experiences at Lincoln Center, not WeWork tables featuring canned, WeWork beer with WeWork appetizers. Step it up..We ended up here for probably the one reason you would: on a cold day we wanted to spend some time together after a show, and real coffee places nearby were all out of seating (Joe, Magnolia). We turned back and wound up here, knowing we'd likely pay a lot for crummy fare, but would have a pretty and warm place to sit undisturbed. Let's face it: that alone is hard to come by in Manhattan, so I'll yield up a star to this overpriced Lincoln Center concession that proudly touts its devotion to Nespresso.I don't know about everyone else, but to me, ""Nespresso"" means ""cardboard-brewed-in-water."" This is what this brand of coffee tastes like to me. I kind of feel like this brand and the photo of their dessert box I am attaching sums up why this place is a mess. They sell cocktails and $8 desserts like ""brioche bread pudding"" that are okay, but they also sell the same low quality donuts you see at the corner delis, and Nespresso. I wanted coffee. They don't have coffee -- ""only espresso"" -- so for the same $5 we tried both of their top-billed coffee drinks, the ""Sonata"" and ""Cantata"". One featured a glob of unmixable honey at the bottom of the drink, the other was mixed with Italian orange. Orange soda . . . and Nespresso. My personal hell has no coffee, just this cocktail. I go to a lot of foo-foo independent cafes. I have never seen this mix. Either Prelude Nespresso Cafe is the sole innovator of an amazing new taste sensation, or orange soda and cardboard-coffee were simply never meant to mingle.I think this cafe will have a usefulness to some. If you want to drop $8 on nothing much, you can sit with a beer or a decent dessert plate. Real food is also available; I suspect some of it is fine. Not trusting a place that menu-buries the $21 quail plate but puts four kinds of $3 Haribo gummies up front, I passed on food. Hot dogs are also available for $8.Service was crap. Although both those drinks are doomed by their recipes, they were also poorly executed. One Cantata came well-mixed, one with the honey lumped at the bottom. One Sonata came without a problem; the other we ordered was denied because he said they were out of orange soda . . . I suspect because his co-worker had the soda in his hand as he made our other drink. But we were there at 4 on a Sunday. I assume a better team is working at busier times. And all day every day, the high, well-lit, open space is there for you, suspiciously rich in available seating..A little pricey, but the expresso coffee was pretty tasty. Also the cheesecake vanilla bean was really really good!Good place, calm and quiet..Came here today with my dad while near the Lincoln center and it was very good.  Staff was very nice and attentive.  Got the Pat Lafrieda burger and it was very yummy.  I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who comes to the Lincoln center because it's quick.  I will be returning..Trying it for the first time wasn't so bad I order a quick  meal before  a performance  and I have to say it was fine  ordering a burger  and it coming out  different. In addition to also French fries well instead of fries I got  potato chips like not  what I expect but hey can't  complain like how people say it better to try something new. Other then that everything was fine  and also the service  was good  so you can say it was good coming here for a quick meal.What can I say, it's a pricey cafe in Lincoln Center, the view outside is pretty lovely (big glass buildings!), and it's very chill! There's wifi and it would be totally fine for meeting a friend for coffee or a snack, in my opinion. Soup of the day was good, so it worked out for a light lunch stop..I recently stumbled upon this cafe and spent an afternoon here before an evening show. It's a beautiful space - calm and quiet with lots of seating and huge glass windows looking out onto the street. I didn't try the food or the Nespresso drinks, but I got a cup of tea for $3 and spent a couple hours doing work in a comfy chair. The server even gave me free hot water and there are bathrooms here, too. A nice place to get some work done and have a meeting, which is hard to find in the area."
"This place redefines your preconceptions about Southern cuisine. Who knew chicken and waffles could be contemporary?Once I entered this swanky joint, I admired the industrial eclectic-modern decor and glowing lantern lights dropping down from the lofty ceiling. Jazz music settled us down into this southern vibe. Immediately my friend, let's call her *C, and I were seated and since the restaurant was relatively desolate, we chose any table we wanted. Glasses were poured, I got my usual lemon and Splenda, and off of the RW menu, we both got the pork belly app. C* loved the tender and succulent slices of pork belly dressed with a bright lime green garlic aioli. Perhaps she enjoyed the well-seasoned salty cook of meat balancing with the refreshing natural sweetness of the cubes of watermelon. Unfortunately, my pork belly was S-A-L-T-Y. It was a difficult challenge to swallow salty piece of meat after another and balance it with the delectable biscuits that they serve to you. Btw, their honey butter is freakin' delicious. Unsettled by my terrible app, I was surprised about my entree. Finally, Gravy saved themselves in the nick of time with their delicious Pan-Roasted Atlantic Salmon. Wow. A+ I have to tell you, because that skin was perfectly crispy with the right amount of pepper alongside those buttery fingerling potatoes making this a standout dish! C* also received a beautifully executed Grilled Pork Loin, cooked medium paired with sweet corn and bacon bits tucked underneath this great juicy cut. Satiated beyond belief, we did not know if we could shove any more calories in our extended tummies. I barely snacked down on the moist spicy bread pudding with chantilly cream and caramel sauce down and C* was physically unable to eat the flaky caloric buttermilk biscuits stacked on her strawberry shortcake, eventually only consuming the tart strawberries and whipped cream. I am satisfied to give Gravy four stars for quick and attentive service, mostly well-executed meals, and gentle ambiance. Although that app was overly salty and the portions a tad small in scope but still completely filling, I am able to look past that, allowing Gravy some redemption by remembering that luscious salmon, dense bread pudding and creamy honey butter. Aside from a few mistakes you could correct with the waiter, I still recommend Gravy if you would like to give neo-Southern cuisine a good go!.Keep your Gravy.  Give me your biscuits!Story of my life...or at least It was tonight.When they arrived, the perfect pair of warm biscuits were a prelude to a beautiful evening.""What is Gravy anyway?""As described by our waiter, a modern ""Southern style"", similar to New Orleans, but specifically ""upscale Southern"".""Cool...""  I say..""  ""Kind of like Pigs in a Duvet, instead of Pigs in a blanket?""   (Didn't happen)First off, I like the décor.Modern but relaxing, with soft (carpeted, colorful, velvet) walls that reduce the noise in this large room.Being tucked in the corner, so close to those walls, as I reached out to touch them, I felt compelled to quote Laverne, from ""Laverne & Shirley"" crying out in my South Jersey accent...  ""THAT'S THE SECOND BEST THING I'VE EVER FELT!!!"" (Didn't happen)Let me tell you this... Life's not all innuendo and sitcom humor at Gravy.......It gets worse........the service was SLOW.  However, (and luckily for the waitstaff), everyone looked so happy to be there, that no one really cared.It took 15 minutes for our drinks to pop out.Another 45 minutes for the entrees.However, just like they say in the South....the Sun don't shine on the same dogs ass every day.The ""shadow"" is surely unapologetic slow service.But the Sun rose on the filet mignon, cooked to perfection and so tender.  ( $31)  coupled with the mashed potatoes, and the other entrée,  the corn flake crusted chicken, rolled, but lackluster compared to the steak.  The generous side of mashed left no room for dessert.Let's face it...these Rebs know how to live...However, the drinks required while waiting pushed this bill to $130+ tip...not inexpensive.In the case of our ""canine story"" The ""shadow"" might be simply working out the kinks of a new cutting edge restaurant, and the sun might be that in our ever changing compass of 2011,  that Gravy just doesn't realize it's North of the Mason Dixon line..So, I definitely would have given the food 2 stars, but the service was pretty good and the ambiance was posh. I had a gilt deal, and went here for a date night :-)We had an early dinner on Saturday night before hitting MSG for a hockey game. To be efficient, we had: Gumbo: meh, it was a little greasy instead of hearty.Fried Chicken: mmmm, kinda burnt, and dryGrits: Sludge, I had hopes but it was thick and was not the classic southern grits I was expectingFish: Light and yummy.So there you go. Given the other reviews, maybe it was an off night, but I probably won't be coming back..I love soul/southern food. I was very eager to check this place out. The decor is nice, set up in the dining area is pretty casual. The bar looks like it's stocked with all the southern staples: bourbon and whiskey. Thursdays is $6 hurricanes. Yummmmmm at the bar only tho. My friend and I ordered the NOLA Waffles: chicken liver pate, onion marmelade and waffles. It was good, the pate could have been a little bit firmer. I prefer country-pate style. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken, which comes with mash potatoes. The chicken was nice and juicy and very flavorful. My friend ordered the Grilled Scallops and honey grits. YUM! Scallops were cooked well and the grits was good. We also ordered the brussel sprouts, it was good... a bit salty but it was ok. I had a few Hurricanes and the  Category 6, similar drinks, but I preferred the Hurricane. Reminds me of being down in NOLA! Ha!By the way, Yelp has a $15 for $30 deal which I was able to get right on my app! I'll definitely be back to try out their brunch menu..Gravy was a bit disappointing.  You expect the food to be upscale Southern food, but it was more lower budget fried food.I came here with my girlfriend on  a Friday night and expected to be wow.  It was more a DOH experience.  For $52 bucks, I ordered from the restaurant week menu.  You do not really have a choice between the restaurant week menu and their regular menu.  There was only 2 entrees and 1 was sold out.  HOW THE HECK are you sold out of something  on a Friday night.I ordered the fried green tomatoes and fried chicken.  Both were sub-par.  When the dessert came out, it was gross and chewy (bread pudding).  On the whole, the restaurant looks like the inside of a circus tent.  The bartenders don't really know what they are doing.  They actually ran out of ginger beer for a drink and they concocted some mixature and had a friend of the owner's try it.  The pictures online and not realy reflective of how small the space it.  There's also a local crowd of youngsters that often come.  They sort of take off the bar.  I'm not coming back.I went here with a close friend last night. It just just ok. The service needs serious improving. They were either trying to take away our food, or completely ignoring us. We both had the cornflake crusted chicken which was very tasty, and the portion was enormous! The bisquits on the table were very good, but I am not sure why everyone thinks the grits are so good. I lived in the south for some time, and these are full of flavor, but missing half of the grittiness of the grits!!!! Much to creamy for my taste. Also, the ""booth"" seating was incredibly uncomfortable, it seems like they were designed for morbidly obese people..E and I came here for brunch - E got a latte and I got a cappuccino - not as good as Balthazar's. E ordered the Baltimore and I got the Amarillo, the waitress mixed up the drink and switched the order.I actually tasted the Baltimore and it was really good and E tried the Amarillo and I asked if E would like to taste the spicier version.E said, the drink is already spicy enough and cannot handle it.I tasted E's and that's when I found out our drinks were mixed up.One sip of the spicy Amarillo with chipotle pepper caused me to sweat immediately.I like it, but I was not in the mood to sweat during brunch, so I opted out and got the Baltimore as well.I was torn between Shrimp Po' Boy and Crawfish Benedict - I ended up getting the Crawfish Benedict, since I was really curious about the crawdads here. When I got my Crawfish Benedict - I couldn't even see my crawfish. I had to seriously look really hard to find them. I only got three itty bitty pieces of crawfish.Seriously?The benedict was on the small scale as well - it looked like baby size versions of other benedicts that I had at other establishments. The taste was a bit bland...perhaps, I should had went with the Po' Boys?E didn't say much about the Omelette, but what we both agree on was the complimentary cornbread was delicious!!!!!E like bloodymary's more thick, but I really enjoyed their bloodymary and the cornbread!I would be open on trying more things here..Gravy was both a hit and a miss. It's a trendy, modern and cool. The ambiance is opposite of what I imagine Southern Comfort Food should be. For me the loft ceilings and cold colors work against how I like comfort food. The scallop grits was delicious. I was extremely happy with dish, but I wish I had it in a different room..I'm not someone to sit here and critique a place for it's decor or how the food doesn't match the space of the restuarant. I'll save that for the snobs who think they're God's gift on this website.This place is exactly what it says it is...upscale southern comfort food. The flavors are intense and just incredible. I went there on a Wednesday night with my girlfriend and it was fairly empty. The wait staff was not overly pushy like you get in those situations sometimes. The food was fantastic, the drinks were strong and very tasty.Let's start with the butter and rolls. The butter is sweet and compliments the warm bread perfectly to the point where I was sold on the place before I even looked at the menu. We got the king crab appetizer and it was delicious and extrmemly flavorful with various textures. For entrees I got the Sullivan Island Bog which was smokey and perfect. It had an abundance of shellfish and you can tell there was a lot of thought that went into that dish. My girlfriend got the grouper and loved it as well. For dessert we split the pecan pie which just oozed southern comfort.This place is wonderful. If you're in the mood for a modern take on southern comfort food, I can't imagine a better place. Will certainly be returning shortly..Fine southern dining.Got their Sullivan Bog. It was kind of small. Other than that, it was amazing. It was like gumbo or jambalaya. Rice, sausage, and a pile of seafood. Shrimp, mussels, crawfish, scallops, etc. Everything was grilled and had a nice crispy outside and juicy inside. The sauce was amazing. The rice was amazing. The presentation was amazing. Actually, a better word is ""exquisite."" You just have to try it. I just wish there was more of it on my plate, for the $26 I paid.Also got Mississippi Mud Pie. Not bad at all.They seem to have a good selection of whiskey and cocktails.There was no wait for a table. It was dinner time on a Saturday."

"~ Here for the vibes ~ I would definitely give this place 5 stars for pretty good coffee and an excellent cafe. Every place has a different taste to their coffee, especially when they have an array of roasts. The flavor of their coffee when I visited was thick and earthy, and I quite like the taste!!! It's not my favorite but it's still enjoyable and tasty. They don't charge extra for ""alternative"" milks either which is really nice and makes being green or easy on the stomach a lot more accessible LOL. Of course the coffee and drinks taste pretty good, and of course they can be expensive since it's more of a fancy coffee shop, but it's worth it, so is the beautiful environment and atmosphere that you get to drink it in.  The cafe interior is beautiful, decorative, and warm; the coziness of this place is unmatched. It's like old library or uncle bookworm's home study! Super nice. I worked there for about two hours and I got a table to my self, and was able to charge my devices while working. There are a few wall chargers along the seating side of the cafe. And it's a wonderful place to work. It's got nice music and atmosphere and people coming and going; it's only mildly distracting because it did get busy and I'm assuming gets been more so. But you can still listen to music and get things done. Whatever.The baristas are pretty nice, and fun to watch, there is a cooler for food and drinks in the front that you can grab and buy things additionally; and in the back there are shelves with cute merch! I bought two cups! They also have wifi too so don't worry about getting connected! It's a super cute cafe with pretty nice coffee, I would definitely go more often! TLDR: old bookstore vibe in a cafe, cute interior and exterior, pretty good coffee, a bit expensive, but otherwise great place..busy coffee shop in Greenwich Village. a short walk from Washington Square Park. small amount of seating inside as well as some outside as well. well-maintained and neatly organized. warm woody interior. a small menu of coffee drinks options as well as coffee beans to grind and brew at home. didn't spend much time here as i wanted a cup of brew to go. the drip coffee was pretty good. perfect company on a cold Spring day. had a doughnut in hand from Doughnut Plant and the pair made for a good combo of sugar and caffeine al fresco. small drip (12 oz) $3.75. staff was pretty curt. the coffee is pretty busy from open to close. drops mic cuz i am percolatingi outzzz.The WORST customer service ever! This is one of my favorite coffee shops I go to but sadly, the staff makes it so much less enjoyable. There's a barista that works there and every time I go, she is incredibly rude to me with so much attitude. It really makes me want to change coffee shops from now on..Barista and staff are super unfriendly and unwelcoming. I'd get if they're having a bad day but I consistently come here (because the coffee is great) but every time I come the baristas are SOOOO rude, they've even rolled their eyes at me. It's actually ridiculous.Even though I drink my fair share of coke brews during the summer time, I'm not big on the fancier chains. I was on my way to barre and was super early and decided to stop here for a cold brew without knowing that this was a well known national establishment. The inside was beautifully decorated but there was no option for indoor seating, which was also maybe why the air conditioner wasn't on when it was almost above 90 degrees outside. They had some good outdoor seating.I got a large cold brew with oat milk and a pump of simple syrup. It was over 6 dollars and I had to double check that this was indeed a large serving of coffee. The coffee was average. It was definitely not worth over 6 dollars. So far, my favorite cold brew this summer has been Proof!.coffee is fantastic, baristas are RUDE. it's to the point where management is extremely questionable and way past the point of ""having a bad day"".Pretty bummed because I was excited to try this place. I don't usually write negative reviews but what should have been my favorite part of the morning (starting off with a latte is a must), was ruined by the baristas bad attitude. Unfortunately, by the looks of the other reviews, it sounds like I'm not the only one who's had this kind of experience with stumptown..I had the original in Portland and loved this place. They have the hands-down best coffee. If you think the blue bottle is good, you will love this place even more. Their coffee bean is so good and we always get a pack to bring back home and it tastes just as good.I am jealous NYC has couple of locations throughout the city. If I had the money I will open one in Houston. Let me know if anyone wants to partner up and open this great franchise. lolTip: Get the bag so you can make them at home cause you will miss their coffee. Follow me on Instagram @willeatfood.Stumptown is a good way to get the morning going with a steamy brew.  You can get the standard brewed or the barista made drinks like an espresso.  The store has a totally inclusive vibe with rainbow flags everywhere.  Decent coffee nice atmosphere with outside seating..S tumbled upon Stumptown in my hood T hirsty for coffee? Yes U nfair how pretty this coffeeshop isM munch on cookies? Why not P hoto ops everywhere inside and outsideT acos for breakfast? DuhO nline? Yes they have Wi-FiW holeheartedly agree with me?N o reason to wait, come here!@thedogtrine"

"First I have to say that the staff are superstars. If you're a regular they remember your order and treat you like a star. The downside are the pretentious customers. Believe me you see all kinds.There's thea) college students who are basically still only high school graduates and have no sense of the real worldb) high school students who believe they're grown ups by going to a Starbucks and yet still don't realize a Frappuccino is not real coffee.c) The newbies who are looking for anything which resembles their sheltered suburban lifed) Young folks who are paying off their coffee consumption with their parent's moneyAnd they all converge at the waiting station for their coffee, avoiding eye contact by re-reading texts they've memorized yet want to appear grown up.Like I said, the staff are superstars!!!.I drive for a living and Satrbucks is my addiction. I've come across a few Starbucks that need to get better customer service, this is not one of them. From the moment i entered all the baristas had smiles on their faces. I'm pretty sure no one likes to get up at 3 in the morning to be serving coffee at 5:30 to a group of demanding individuals, but if this is the job you chose why not do it with a smile?From the moment I walked into the Starbucks, Marquis the cashier and Felicia the barista had such a wonderful attitude it  made my day. This Starbucks is on my top 3 list. Thanks Felicia and Marquis for such a wonderful experience. I hope to become a regular..The baristas have no sense of urgency.  The cashier moved like molasses and the one making the drinks, made the wrong drink and the label clearly stated what I ordered. When it was brought to her attention her reply was, ""Oh, okay..."" she wasn't empathetic at all. I just waited 10 minutes to order, the bathroom was a mess, there was a dog tied to a shopping cart blocking the entrance to the store... this place is a disaster..Avoid that location the place is small and crowded with kids ;( specially around 4 pm while on line I saw a lot of people coming in and walking out due to line and the display are all empty and poorly arranged That location need a new manager But what can I say Starbucks is Starbucks when you need your coffee you just deal with the extra oh and the staff is rude so I ask one of the girl for milk and she snapped because she was talking to her future ex boyfriend however I waited 5 min before I interrupter her said sorry can I have milk and she was like we don't have any as she was pouring milk in a plastic cup to make w drink for the guy she was talking to .....You already know about the constants. The coffee is typical good Starbucks coffee. Now about the variables... The staff here is always friendly. it is spacious and always kept clean. It has an edgy-industrial vibe going on. There are outlets at every table. There is NO restroom so if you're planning on staying a while I would keep liquid intake to a minimum or bring a foley catheter (lulz). One thing that irks the heck outta me is the tables and stools. They are very awkward! There is maybe one table that you can semi-comfortably use, however the heights of the tables are different but all have the same height tall-stools. You're either reaching way up, or huddling way down over the table. Not conducive to reading / studying / whatevs..Spacious and the service was pleasant. On top of that it was also speedy, I might have waited 60 seconds for my coffee if that..I come to his location about 4 times a week. Staff continues to be great and the line moves quickly but note that when school is in session students can over run the place. Just be aware of what times classes are coming out.  Also an occasional street beggar will wander in and hit everyone up in line which adds to the ambiance..Great place but avoid the hours when kids get off from school. Otherwise, you'll see this small location crowded with noisy and rowdy masses of teenagers, who also hover around the nearby 99cent pizza place and 7-11. On calmer hours, while the place is small, it's interior design is gorgeous, consistent with the stunning makeover of all Starbucks branches - dark wood, low key warm lighting, soothing music.Don't expect a private table though. Like what I noticed in many Starbucks locations, emphasis is on long common tables with tall chairs. It's fine with me if it helps turn away Carrie Bradshaw-wannabes who stay in a fixed table the whole day by just buying one cup of coffee while typing on that ever-self-important blog. Sigh, you know the type.Of course, once in a while, you get the next worse version of this entity  - the Over-Sharer. Like two nights ago, a girl was on Skype with her friend, talking loudly on the screen, over sharing via indirect sharing, with the whole small cafe, her medical check up and in an attempt at depth, declares that 'I mean, like, Life is kinda like, short.' (Yes, she really spoke with a lot of Likes that I don't like). When I heard that, I said to myself - Ok. That's deep, girl...Anyway, there is no bathroom here, FYI, where I could puke because of this girl's lack of courtesy to the other customers trying to enjoy their latte while listening to the chill music being played. So in case you have other uses for the bathroom, there is none here and you are better off going to the McDonalds at the corner. But, McD + bathroom = yuck. You now the drill. They're not really as well-maintained as Starbucks. Hello???There's wifi here also. Gets a little slow at times. I blame Over-sharing Skype Girl.What else? Staff is nice. Understaffed I think and I'm sure they know it. Overall, thank you for this Starbucks location. The Dekalb Ave subway station area just got a dose of class and an oasis of potential quiet..Possibly the worst Starbucks I've been to. They don't ask your name, service is super slow and there's no order to which beverages are delivered. I've never seen anything quite like it for the Starbucks chain..I never come to Starbucks and now I remember why..... The line is terribly long. There aren't that many people in line ahead of me -maybe 4or 5- and it takes waiting in line a good 10-15 minutes. Ridiculous. & Super slow"
"Love Sosta. Food is solid, especially the pastas. The pizza is great and the wine pours are generous. Super nice people and just a sweet spot to sit and relax. Seriously worth it..My friends and I were acting foolhardy, I suppose. I mean, well, there were nine of us - nine! - and we were hungry. In Brooklyn. At 9pm on a Friday night. After being laughed at by a couple of places, we walked by a near-empty Sosta.""Screw it, it's empty,"" a pal said, fearing that a noticeable lack of patronage must surely equate to a potential food poisoning. Just then, the drizzle turned to rain, and we decided to go in anyway, trichinosis be damned.We popped in, our party of nine, and were greeted graciously. Simply sparking service. Delicious wine. Yummy bread. You can tell the pizza was made with love (I had the Calabrezze). A bunch of my pals also got pizzas - all raved.Oh, you may want to request they ""go easy"" on the garlic if you get a pasta dish. We had the mushroom and pancetta dish - scrumptious, but garlic overload. Other than that, it was a happy accident..This cute little spot on Atlantic serves up better-than-average pizza. The crust is often excellent, and I watched the guy manning the wood-burning oven hold the pie next to the flame to get that perfect char. Unfortunately, certain ingredients are not always as fresh as they could be.* In particular, the mushrooms they use come out of a can, and it's unmistakable.However, when the pies are good, they are very good. I'm partial to the Calabrese, topped with tomato sauce, fior di latte, sopressata, olives, garlic and chili flakes. Stay away from mushrooms and you'll be just fine.The other dishes tend to be hit or miss. I enjoy the Caesar salad, despite it being the only Caesar I'm aware of that includes balsamic vinegar. The burrata appetizer, while beautifully presented, employs far too much radicchio and the bitterness overwhelms the creamy cheese without enough of the dried figs to balance it out. The pastas are also inconsistent; the rich sauces are often winners, but again, the canned mushrooms are a turn off.All in all, Sosta seems like a spot where ordering correctly is paramount to your enjoyment. As long as you stick to pizza and a salad, I've found it to be A-OK.___________*For freshness and pies of the highest order in the 'hood, try Lucali to the south, and Sottocasa farther east on Atlantic..Romantic brick oven pizza located on Atlantic Ave.  Has a ton of potential, but for a beautiful Saturday night there were only a couple of tables filled.  We came with a $20 groupon and am glad we did as they are way overpriced.  Appetizers average $13, salads come in around $12 and pizza is about $16.  Went right for the pizzas because of the pricing of the starters.  We shared two pies.  Campagnola which was Fior di Latte, Gorgonzola, spinach, mushrooms and olives.  The Gorgonzola added a nice dimension, but everything else fell flat.  Second pie ordered was the Molisano which consisted of tomato sauce, Fior di Latte, Roasted eggplant, zucchini and peppers.  Toppings and pizza slid right off the crust and was a sloppy mess.  Very disappointing.  The Nutella calzone sounded intriguing, but I almost got the impression they would have messed that up too.I honestly don't see them lasting which is a shame because it looks nice, but I wouldn't come back.  Looks aren't everything.  Paulie Gee's in Greenpoint blows Sosta away.  I'd rather wait there and pay about the same..Hmmm not really super impressed by this place.  I came here at about 6:35pm and sat towards the front.  It was not very crowded but seemed like more a wine bar than a pizza joint.  Perhaps I should have stuck with more wine and less food!  The menu was good - a large variety of pizza choices and appetizers/ salads.  I asked the waitress what she suggests and I decided to go with the ""Calabrese"" which had tomato sauce, mozzarella, sopressata, olives & spicy oil.  We each had a glass of wine and did not order any appetizers.  When the pizza came out I must say it looked better than it tasted.  The portion was big but to me it just didn't blow my mind.  The pizza was so difficult to cut that we were brought steak knives and I ended up just using my hands because it was so hard.  The spicy oil was a bit overwhelming I felt like I couldn't taste any of the soppressata which looked more like peperoni to me (hey I'm only half Italian but I know my cold cuts...) and there were literally 3 black olives on the whole pie.  Now I could see if the olives were some sort of fancy or expensive ingredient like truffles but honestly how much could it cost to add a few extra black olives on the pie?No dessert, I was stuffed.  The bill was like $30 plus tip, really?  I mean the pizza was ok but nothing out of this world..Not sure what I was expecting. I'm from Brooklyn, but I've never really understood the whole gourmet pizza craze. In either case, I came to Sosta to celebrate a buddy's birthday. The place is super dark, but cozy. You can see into the kitchen and watch the chefs at work.For two of us, we shared a Lucana pizza (sausage, peppers and mozzarella), a Umbria pizza (mozzarella, pancetta, prosciutto), and an order of the Gamberi (black linguine with shrimp).The pizzas were alright, but nothing special. There was more crust than there needed to be, so it just ended up being filling without too much substance. My buddy also ordered the Umbria without prosciutto, and when they came out with it, they added ham or something similar to it instead. They didn't actually ask if we wanted a replacement meat, so that was a little bit weird.The pasta was pretty good, and came with a reasonable amount of shrimp.Not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was worth coming to at least once..Found this sleek but cozy place via groupon or similar deal, and am glad I did - the wood-oven cooked gourmet pizza is outstanding and so is the salad.  Nice thin crust on the pizza, light on the ingredients but that's perfect for this thin crust pizza. Fresh ingredients and nice dressing made for a very nice salad, and wine selection is pretty good.  The decor is upscale and sleek, but the wood oven and low-key service make this place cozy. But what is up with pizza pricing these days?!  Sosta and a couple other pizza places seem to now be pricing individual pizzas similar to entrees, instead of pizzas.  Without the groupon, this would be more than I would want to spend for two pizzas, 1 salad and some wine.   I'll go back, happily, but only with another coupon in tow..This place really warrants four-stars, not five but the extra star is for its place in the foodie wasteland that is Brooklyn Heights.The 12"" pizzas produced by the wood-burning oven are absolutely delicious -- thin crust, charred at the edges and chewy throughout.  The toppings are of good quality and used appropriately - neither skimpy nor too voluminous to overwhelm the delicious crust. They run from $10-$17 each. The only problem with the pies?  Cut into four slices, they are large enough that three slices is enough for one person.  But they are so good that you'll dive into that fourth slice.  The wines are tasty and reasonable: $7-$12 per glass.  Tuesday's are a great deal with 50% off any bottle.The service is friendly, effective and sincere. They chose a quasi-lounge vibe for the place which is fine.  A 42"" plasma above the bar plays black-and-white films (no sound) which works really well.  One day it's Laurel & Hardy, the next is Felini and then John Wayne in ""Stagecoach"".  I eat here every 10-14 days because the neighborhood desperately needs solid restaurant options beyond all the greasy Asian/sushi take-out joints on Montague.A high-end pizza joint that delivers is a welcome addition.  Fascati is great for that traditional NY slice but here you can order a wonderful pie with burrata, sopresseta, shaved parmesan and arugula.  As for comparisons with Lucali?  The pizzza is on par with Lucali with three signficant advantages:  it's located 1/2 mile closer to Montague than Lucali; there's no line out the door for a table (yet); and they deliver!If you live near Henry & Atlantic I urge you to give Sosta your business -- you are performing a community service that will also leave you stuffed with delicious pizza..Sosta, the Pauly D (Jersey Shore) of pizza spots.Authentic Italian restaurant meets lounge music bar.This place serves a pretty decent old style pizza.  However, my ideal pizza joint is a run-down family shop where the pizza speaks for itself.  4 on food, 2 on atmosphere, and 2 on price.  My bill was $26 for a personal pizza (4 small slices) and a salad to split with my girlfriend.  Not the best deal on the block.....Not quite a 5 star experience, but definitely a great addition to the neighborhood. The only bummer? We wanted to try the burrata pizza, and they didn't have any burrata that night! But we settled on a salad to share (argula and parm) and the Calabrese. The balsamic dressing on the arugula was a little heavy, but still a nice complement to the parm. The Calabrese was just enough to feed the two of us with enough room left for dessert, and the sopressata on the pizza was unusually tasty. I did think it was a litlte funny that they claimed to use a spicy oil as I still had to douse my pieces liberally with red pepper, but it was really good otherwise. Dessert was a little less successful (sad), but not a disaster. Berry sponge cake for me and the bomba for my favorite dinner partner. The white chocolate cover on the bomba was good, as was the sorbet. The berry cake, however, kind of a dud. The berries had a weird gelatin holding them together, and the cake was bland. Definitely a misfire, but not worth losing a star since everything else was good. A little pricey overall, but nice. We'll be back!"

"Always a good opportunity to get delicious cookies. A bit on the pricey side so we only visit once every couple of months. We use to live in Philly so this is a nice bit of east coast. Service is always helpful. Venue itself is huge for a cookie store.Recently had a new matcha cookie and it's pretty darn good if you like all things matcha!We are always coming back for me. Just beware it can get pricey quick.Happy eating!.Loved having dessert delivered to our hotel room!!  The cookies and ice cream were perfect!.Love the warm cookies. I had the chocolate chip and hubby had sugar cookies. Amazing especially when you need something late night to snack on..These cookies are the best - always served fresh and still warm!  Choose from a large assortment of classics - oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, MandM, peanut butter, etc.  They also offer some deluxe options - brownie, chocolate peanut butter, etc.And, they are open until 3 am!  They can meet your sweet tooth craving - day or night.  YUM!.Going to insomnia Cookies the service sometimes lacking but the cookies are good. I have experienced the rude lady working but have also had great service for another.  I had a $5 coupon they couldn't figure out how to use it. So I didn't get the discount that day. The cookies will keep my business not the service. Need to work on customer service experience and you will see the business grow. Keep the service the was it is and you may be out of business soon..I'm proud. I walked in with the intention of only purchasing one cookie and I stuck with that. One deluxe chocolate peanut butter cup cookie it was. The main thing that makes Insomnia so great is that the cookies are served straight outta the oven. Warm, melted chocolate graces your taste buds and the freshness is real. You will have to shell out a bit of cash for these pups but it's a treat that I'm willing to pay for..Cookies are delicious, as is the ice cream. Great little place for some sweet treats. However, the middle-aged woman working there was HORRIBLE. I had never been to IC before, and told her this, and asked some questions about the menu. She rolled her eyes, let out exaggerated sighs, and responded with a ""uh, DUH!"" attitude. Like I was back in middle school, annoying her. SO unprofessional. So RUDE. Then, when I told her I had a coupon, she acted like it was the largest inconvenience... sighing, hitting things, even complaining to me!!?! The customer for having a flippin coupon!!!We came with 8 people from work - all came in at different times as our work ended... and at one point she asked, ""well how many more of you are there cuz I have other stuff I need to get done"".Literally never had a worse experience of ""customer service"" in my life. Thank god the cookies were good, but don't know I'll be back..Insomnia cookies typically taste great but if you are waiting for a delivery at night you might just fall asleep before they get to you. The workers often feel stressed and it rubs off on the customer as well. Most of the time this location is out of the cookies you'd want so you'll be waiting for them to cook more. Overall great cookies just not convenient..They have very tasty cookies but cannot get your order right.  Then they give you coupons but screws that up too.  I usually do not complain online about stuff but when its constantly a problem. They need to fix it.  Sad to say I will no longer be a customer..Ok I wouldn't normally pay $8.50 for 6 cookies, but they were having a deal and I heard so many good things. I paid around $15, including tip and delivery fee, for about 12 cookie and let me tell you, it was worth every penny. They arrive hot and fresh and in a little pizza size box. The delivery dude didn't seem super enthused, but I wouldn't be either if I were delivering at like 2am.They have weekly deals and I never knew places like this existed. They deliver until 3am! I think it's a fantastic idea and they should be in all major college towns. I will be ordering from them again very soon.Their lemon white chocolate and chocolate mint are amazing!"

"I did not think much of the tiny ""hole-in-the-wall"" location and often passed it up.  Well I finally went in because the other guys were not following proper mask procedures.  So, I finally checked out this BK.  I was happily surprised to see all the employees wearing masks above their noses and wearing gloves.  I see them all working hard and together.  I felt confident to come back, walking from Patchen Ave.  And my third time, I still saw the same safety procedures being followed.  As long as I keep seeing this great team effort to keep safe, my children and I will keep making this long walk.  I always thought food prep handlers should have been wearing masks, before the pandemic.  I hope fast  food and other restaurants and eateries keep this up; it creeps me out to see workers spraying as they talk over customers' food.What was even nicer, was that in spite of the location, this BK did not have panhandlers begging for money at their door or hanging out inside the restaurant.Your efforts are noticed and appreciated,Satisfied Customer.20+ minutes to get my food. Slowest Burger King experience I've ever had. Huge line of people waiting. Slow, slow, slowwwwwww staff. Nobody cares. Worked a hard long day, and just wanted a quick and easy dinner. Forget that!Also got my drink order wrong, and couldn't just correct it on the spot, and had me wait two more minutes just for that. Never coming back..Dirtiest Burger King in the Western Hemisphere. Rude and stupid employees. If you were too good for a job at Burger King then wouldn't you be better at that job? I wouldn't feed a third world country with their French fries. Place truly sucks lol..I would give this Burger King a 0 if possible. I never, NEVER have reviewed anything on Yelp, I only browse. Rude employees with big wait times. I ordered medium fries, 1, ONLY 1, and they took almost 15min complete the order. It takes a seconds to serve a fries. And the place itself looks rundown and not often cleaned. Again I haven't rated anything on this app ever before, I am usually the one who looks at them instead of writing them, but if I am writing one it's probably shows on how bad my experience was in this Burger King. Never coming here again..staff are actually very friendly good customer service but i am very disappointed i ordered mozzarella sticks and it smells like burned plastics and looks disgusting. never has happened to me ...I usually go in the morning around 8:39 a.m and there are two blk females and a small Indian guy with glasses . Those two females constantly verbally abuse him. They talk to him like he's  crap and call him stupid in front of customers . It's not cool at all !!! Mind you they always have an attitude too !.Staffs are very friendly! I'm going there twice a week :) I wish they make the beef little more moist(A bit dry) but not bad at all..Awful wait time for an order to be placed. Holding meaningless conversations is more important than serving customers. Why are there always only 2 - 3 people working. Poor management..This place is not too bad.  The food comes out fresh, well as fresh as fast food can be. As long as they are serving my spicy chicken sandwich crispy how I like it I cant really complain. The setup in this joint looks like a Greyhound station but it is what it is."

"The corn tortilla was good and the seasonal veggie filling with guacamole was good but put them together and it was a mess. They should drain the liquid from the veggies before putting them in the tortilla. I ended up eating the filling with a fork and the tortilla afterwards. The filling had a nice kick. I'm giving four because even with a fork I had to wash my hands afterwards and they had a bathroom I could use..The corn tortilla was good and the seasonal veggie filling with guacamole was good but put them together and it was a mess.

I'm giving four because even with a fork I had to wash my hands afterwards and they had a bathroom I could use..Absolutely fantastic. Probably my favorite tacos ever. Their crispy short rib tacos are the things dreams are made of. All of their tacos really are excellent, so much flavor and very fresh! I've also gotten their taco bowl which is a major upgrade from the usual mexican chain. Their chips and salsa, also excellent! I highly recommend the masa fries, not like anything else I've ever had, but the texture is great, the seasoning is better, and the dipping sauce is peak flavor awesomeness!.This places reminds me of Torchy's Tacos back home except not as many options to choose from. I got a carnitas taco. It was great. The meat was tender and the ingredients were fresh. It was juicy without making my corn tortilla fall apart. The staff was friendly and the area was clean. Not busy for lunch time on a Thursday. I'll return if I'm really feeling a taco or trying one of the burritos or bowl..This place was super tasty and also super affordable. We stopped in between theater shows yesterday.Two tacos will run you about $6-7 which in NYC is a steal. My friend got a salad for like $11 and said it was very tasty. I got a carne asada taco and a chicken taco - both were a bit spicy but very good. The Brussels sprouts taco looked really good too.Their bathroom cracked me up - their sign basically says no Instagramming while on the toilet.... lol..Tried this once, and that's enough for me to say I'm definitely not coming back. I ordered the seasonal veggies tacos, which are just low-quality soft tortillas filled with mushrooms, cilantro, and onions. I also specifically said NO cilantro, but they added it anyways. The employees staffed at the time (Sunday afternoon) seemed nonchalant and careless. Aside from that, the tacos tasted really exotic and far from what is Mexican. I also ordered a side of rice and beans, which was mediocre. There are more authentic Mexican places throughout the city. Do yourselves a favor and skip this place..I was having such a bad day... until I came here for lunch! every time I come here the staff is always quick, on point, and nice. I'm always taking my order with the girl in the front. This lunch truly made my day, I have not been (hopefully not) disappointed yet!.Boy have I been missing out... Decided to try a new place today for lunch. I came in around 12:45ish and thank god it wasn't busy. I ordered 2 carnitas tacos and 1 chicken. These are probably the best tacos I've ever had. The pork and chicken were delicious, I inhaled my food at my desk. The seasoning on the chicken won me over the carnitas (and i looove pork). The horchata was amazing, I should have gotten two. The meat was very juicy and my food smelt amazing, the temptation of wanting to eat was taunting; especially being in a crowded elevator and the aroma was overpowering everything else. I'm so glad I walked in, I will be walking here whenever I want a taco. Thank god for closing at midnight, you'll be my new favorite drunk food!.(3.5 stars) A solid late night bite for sure. It's not too pricey and plenty filling. The carne asada, guac, and crema were super tasty. The gorgon though was definitely not what I was expecting. It was described as a taco bowl, but really it's just a flat, oily patty which doesn't taste bad by any means but is super heavy. I wish I went with my gut and got the salad, despite it being like 5 dollars more than the gorgon. :/The chips and salsa were somewhat disappointing. The chips were pretty stale, likely sitting bagged for most of the day, but after asking for a fresh batch they were much better. The hot sauce was the better of the two, sadly the salsa verde was watery and bland..A1 tacos! A little more expensive than your usual Mexican spot but still reasonable. They pack each taco with ingredients so not only are they Instagram worthy but they're also worth the price. I think the best part is the corn tortilla which they make on the spot. My favorites were the shrimp and the chicken, my bf had the carnitas and didn't like them as much. Make sure to add guac and crema! The masa fries are also really tasty and they come with a spicy mayo sauce. They have a small seating section outside so I will def. be coming back during the summer..There are a million and one places to eat in Manhattan but This is one you gotta try!The people that work here are absolutely fantastic!  I am truly impressed with the service.The tacos are served on thicker home made style shells that are soft but hold together nicely.Carnitas taco was the best with the carne asada a close second.I walked 2 miles to get here and it was worth it !Will I be back?  Yes!.Great service and great street tacos. Beer was very cold! Perfect! I got street tacos and a fish taco. My husband got a carnita taco and a shrimp taco. All were excellent! My son got the shrimp tacos and not a bit was leftover. Great food...and happy, good natured staff..Great service and great street tacos. Beer was very cold! Perfect! I got street tacos and a fish taco. My husband got a carnita taco and a shrimp taco. All were excellent! My son got the shrimp tacos and not a bit was leftover. Great food!"

"I ordered off grub hub for a set pick-up time. Grub hub must've messed up because I received a text that it was ready about 20-30 mins prior to the set time. Thankfully, the host had such a great demeanor and had the kitchen put in the order for immediate (the wait was about 10 mins). I ordered the following:Bombay- Curried chicken with chick peas, cilantro, and scallions You can definitely taste the curried chicken. It was packed full. It can get a little dry so I added the green sauce. Brasil- ground beef, olives, onions, and potatoesThis was the first empanada I pulled out of the order. At first, I found the hot shell to be salted well with the beef but as I kept eating, the beef was overly salted too so the whole thing wasn't enjoyable. Cuban- pork with mozzarella cheese and sofrito sauce This tasted like a pulled pork cheesy pizza, which was delicious! I would order this again. Portobello- mushroom, cabbage, ginger with soy, scallion and cilantroI did not enjoy the initial smell but the strong mushroom flavor was there Desayuno Colombiano- pork sausage, cheddar, eggs, onion, steak The first several bites were just of cheddar and egg. It was packed full though but it reminded me of a breakfast item. I appreciated that there were two bathrooms available, both unisex with a sink outside the bathrooms. The empanadas were still hot after 40 mins on the train. The outer shell was definitely on point with the crunch, thickness, and flavor. I didn't particularly love any of the empanadas but I'd come here for one or two as a quick snack if I was in the area. Again, excellent customer service. The front staff was awesome; she had a great attitude..This place is a hit or miss. Sometimes the food and service is great. Sometimes the service is lackluster and in turn you don't know if your Americanized empanadas are worth the thirty-minute wait for them.Here's what I've tried:Cubano: slow-roasted pork, mozzarella cheese, sofrito sauce. Hits the spot.El Toro: Ox-tail, maduros (plantains), Jamaican pepper, chipotle, carrots...a lot going on. Too much for any individual ingredient to stand out. Wouldn't order again.Pepperoni: Two words--Hot Pocket.Cheeseburger: my favorite. Yeah, I know--and I stand by this statement. Cheesy, meaty goodness from first to last bite.Buffalo Chicken: Where's the buffalo sauce? That noted, where's the blue cheese that's supposed to come with it? Buffalo chicken and blue cheese are like fries and ketchup. Come on now, y'all.Chicken Curry: great the first time; average the second. Sigh, so good the first time I ordered it !Spinach and Cheese: Second-favorite. Simple cheesiness. Would gladly order half a dozen of these and the cheeseburger and call it a day. Cilantro sauce: where it is at! I could dip any savory finger food into this sauce sent to us from the gods themselves. I wouldn't dare eat a single empanada here without a good two-three sides of it. And no one should, either.Empanada Mama is decent enough if you're starving and aren't feeling like late-night pizza. It's definitely not a place I'd ever become a regular at, even with my random cilantro sauce cravings from time to time..Decided to stop by here as my friends and I were making our way to the train station. Upon walking in, there were QR codes on the wall to scan for the menu. I thought this was convenient and relieves the stress of deciding at the register. As we were standing, an employee came from around the register to approach customers waiting to make sure they're being helped. Once he got to me I went to the register to order. I had to get the pizza empanada which was cheese and pizza sauce. SO GOOD! There were many solid vegetarian options for me too.If you want to dine in, they have an area in the back. I didn't get to check it out but that's an option..Empanada Mama has still got it. My boyfriend and I stopped in for a snack and ordered the spicy chicken wheat flour empanada, pernil empanada (best of the two) and yucca frita. The yucca was perfectly fried, and I loved the avocado dip. Great service, too (we dined in)..Great curry empanada in a small lower east side shop, plenty to try here so come prepared to split with friends.An LES gem  Always going for the El Toro & BBQ Pulled Pork Empanadas Must Note: M2 security guard Gabriel was very professional and helpful.If you're ever in LES Or work around this area & don't know what to eat. THIS IS WHERE YOU EAT! This should actually be your first stop. There are options to do takeout and dine in. If you're coming for lunch there a special where you can get 2 empanadas and rice and beans for $12 dollars. There are so many empanada options. There is truly one for anybody, if you're not into small bites they also have meal options. There's always someone there willing to give you suggestions.For the past two weeks every time I go in to the office I always stop by here for lunch. I get two empanadas. Shredded chicken and cheese burger. Can't go wrong with those two and though they taste great alone, the addition of the red and green sauce takes it to another level.Check this spot out soon.I feel so conflicted leaving this review, but it's only right that Empanada Mama gets its due credit. I've never had Latin food in NY as good as I've had at EM. Honestly, from the heaping bowl of crispy plantain chips to the fat strips of perfect crunchy and chewy chicarrones, I already thought the appetizers were enough for a few meal. But, wait, there's more! Then the actual empanadas came out, and EM continued to floor me. The viagra wheat empanada is unlike anything I've had. It's completely packed with seafood and perfectly crunchy on the outside while being so soft and delicate on the inside. Drizzle some green sauce over it, and dear lord, I was in tastebud heaven. Had to order another after that, even though I also had a corn pulled pork (love the dense masa) and wheat el toro. Can't wait to come back and drop more money on these delights..The set up is a little confusing if you're going in for dining versus to go. Also the servers didn't seem super organized on if people had taken orders or check if everything was still available. My friend and I ordered 5 empanadas and churros. The empanadas were all delicious however we weren't told until after we finished those that the churros were sold out. I think it's just something that should've been checked at ordering. Prices are fairly good for the area and the empanadas themselves come out super fast..This place is amazing!!! I've heard so many good things about this place. They have several locations. We placed a takeout order. You can get 20% of your first order and 15% off future orders through the app if you use code ""MAMA15"". My friend and I ordered several different empanadas and shared. My favorite ones were the Jerk Chicken and Ground Beef. The Spicy Chicken and Pepperoni Ones were also okay. I highly recommend getting a side of rice with the black beans. The black beans have so much flavor. I'll definitely be back!"

Delicious Chinese food. Maybe the best in Brownsville!!!!I have tried different ones in the areas and couldn't find that taste I was looking for until I ordered Hong like....Very bad at responding people at the phone and also very rude attitude toward to clients.

"Very nice hk style hotpot. Had the spicy chicken broth and it was really good. It's a bit on the pricey end but the service was really good. We went on a weekend and made reservations. The food was fresh and portion was right too. I suggest to dine in instead of taking out as the flavor is not the same. We had that pre vaccine time and it wasn't the same as dining in. Support local and there's not a lot of good dining place on 18th Ave..The hype for the broth is real. My cousin and I had the pork bone broth and it was very flavorful. There were big chunks of pork on bones, tomatoes, and corn. We ordered a bunch of our favorites and it was delicious soaking up the broth: tofu skin roll, fatty beef, pork belly, fried fish skin, mushroom plate, spinach, fish filet sole, and vermicelli noodles. All the meat and fish fillets were smooth and fresh.While it was great hot pot, it is not cheap. My cousin and I ran up a tab of $140. Nonetheless, we thought it was worth it..So for a decent spicy chicken pot and hotpot afterwards this is the place to come. The spicy chicken pot was pretty good for the price. We ordered it medium spicy. Probably can go with ultra spicy too. The hotpot was very well priced compare to other competitors. Beef quality was good. Only complain was you couldn't make your own sauce. Meaning they have no sauce bar. If that add that it'll make it that much better and 1 extra.So for a decent spicy chicken pot and hotpot afterwards this is the place to come. The spicy chicken pot was pretty good for the price.

I had Spicy Chicken Pot, but I really believe that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Staff are really friendly. They're attentive, polite and always on their game. Would certainly recommend Hot Spot Nabe to everyone..Unique hot pot base with pricier options. They have very interesting base flavors. We got the HK style chicken pot ($35) which came with a very generous portion of chicken pre-cooked in a saucy thick broth. So you eat the chicken first (we ordered rice on the side) and then ask them to add the soup for cooking other a la carte items.We weren't sure of the portions for the chicken pot (mild with a kick), which needed up being more than enough for the 2 of us. The sauce got pretty salty quickly so we had to add the soup before finishing the chicken. Good thing is that most things we ordered were veggies and some tofu and fish ball with roe. The a la carte items were pretty generous portions (e.g. 6-8 pieces of most things in 1 order). Highlights: winter melon, watercress, mushroom platter.But we still walked away feeling super full and guilty. Came out to be $45/person including tax and tip, which was very reasonable compared to AYCE ones that have less special flavors and quality items..I just love it when I come across pictures of food posted by fellow Yelpers. What makes it even more exciting is that it's labeled as a ""Hot New Business"". Next thing you know, I'm sitting down at this place hours after I bookmarked it. I get all sad when I watch Asian food travel shows. I see all these trendy eats, and this Spicy Chicken Casserole happens to be one of them. Because it only comes in spicy, and the other casseroles needs to be preordered a day in advance, my husband and I were all out of options since we had the kids with us. I was totally bummed until our server went out of her way and asked the kitchen to cook our hot pot items separately in their pork bone soup if we really ordered the spicy casserole. Service was fantastic, it was a great experience. Let's get back to the casserole. Not only is it an entree, but it turns into hot pot once you finish the chicken, I mean how cool is that? Hot broth is added to deglaze whatever is leftover in the casserole, transforming into a chicken soup based hot pot. Amazingly delicious, genius. The raw food for hot pot is fresh, and beautifully plated. The sauce is mixed at the table, with a big platter of various condiments, which gets taken away when your pot comes. We didn't use any at all in the end. The soup was so jam packed with flavor that the unseasoned cooked food came out seasoned. I highly recommend checking this spot out. I'm definitely coming back. Bringing my family, friends, and everyone else. I don't care, I'm self inviting to your dinner, too..This place is not bad for the price, it is slightly more affordable compared to mister hotpot with the soup base starting at $30 which is a 2 way dish. I got the spicy chicken pot and after you are done eating the chicken you use it as a soup base. I liked that it was a little different compared to other hot pot places and they have this cute theme where some of the drinks come in little light bulbs. They have a variety of selections and they have my favorite tofu skin rolls that a lot of other places don't have. The service was decent and I liked that the wait was not too long.The highlight was probably the wagyu beef with gold flakes it was nicely presented and the texture was a lot better than that of regular fat beef. (It's a splurge  $40) I wouldn't get it again cause it's way too expensive but I'm glad I got to try it. As a lot of others have mentioned compared to mister hotpot I still like mister hotpot better..Love the soup base, like drunken duck, spicy chicken, Razer clam, wagyu, wait staff, all good, nothing you say but good !  I did telling all my friends and bring friends there already !  I am arrange to go again !!.I wasn't a fan of this place. I feel they are overpriced. Their fatty beef slices are too thick. There is limited options for making your own sauce. I wasn't a fan of their fish roe balls. I order this at every hot pot place. The service was good. I like getting the Mochi ice cream at the end. Sadly I think I will stick to AYCE places..This is a hidden gem out of all the restaurants I been to. The food is amazing and the service is top of the line. I highly recommend this place, you guys will enjoy it. Will be back whenever I am in the area!"
"busy Mickey Ds location from people working in the area + NYU students. don't come here that often. however the location has improved--it's cleaner than before, there are touchscreen kiosks, and indoor dining is open. still not open late. PRO TIP: use the McDonalds app. it makes ordering so simple. ordered takeout here most recently. food was bagged neatly and was ready right as i walked in (timing is everything ha). food was standard Mickey Ds consistency. staff seems fine and works hard drops mic cuz i am lovin' iti outzzz.i wanna give you a 0 but that's not possible so i give you a 1. Anyway, one of the employees had an attitude. I asked for a ranch and she gave me sweet and sour? And when i confronted her i saw her poke her long nails in them!! The food was fine.Stopped by to pick up the pokemon happy meal because apparently they're selling out of the playing cards or the Pikachu boxes at other McDonalds locations in New York City. They had a lot left, it was a quick process for ordering and picking up. Had no issues with their customer service or my order either..There were only 2 people working here at 6:30 pm Thursday evening so everyone HAD to order at the kiosk. I don't know what they were doing for people who only had cash.  One person was making the food  & the other was bagging.  For what they had to deal with, they did an okay job. But definitely understaffed! The fries were old & cold, as was the hot fudge for my sundae. I didn't think it was possible to have a bad tasting hot fudge sundae.  The mixer on the McFlurry machine wasn't working so they couldn't mix the oreos into the ice cream- so my son got ice cream topped with oreos instead of of a mcflurry.  Had someone been at the register, they might have been able to tell me this & I woulda ordered something else.  I already don't like coming to McDonald's, but the kids love it so I decided to treat them.  This put me off of McDonald's even more!  Really bad visit..The place is disgusting, like it should be closed down for sanitary reasons its so bad. Plus they closed their seating to save money on cleaning costs... Pieces of Russian scums, LONG LIVE UKRAINE!.Several seating areas are closed most of the time to save on cleaning costs at the expense of health considerations (social distancing) and basic customer satisfaction.The tables are dirty at all times.The bathroom has been permanently closed since the pandemic.Unlike other restaurants in NYC, proof of vaccination is never effectively checked.The general ambiance is very dark and sinister with no natural light and no decorations.The staff really don't look like they are relatives of Ron McDonald's. They look more like your average New Yorkers on their commute during rush hour (= never smiling!)In short, this place is 100% unsanitary, dirty, unfriendly, and can sometimes even be hostile towards its very own customers..actually the worst manager in existence don't go here if u actually want food..For McDonald's standards, it's ok. Not the worst, but could be better. Service speed ok and location looked fairly clean and updated. I got a McGriddle and sausage McMuffin with egg. The McGriddle was not dry. The McMuffin's English muffin was dry and a tad stale. I also found egg shells in the egg. I almost cut my gums. On the bright side at least I know they used real whole eggs..Alright location, yellow line and the 6 train aren't too far of a walk. Quite a few tables and seats. One gender neutral washroom downstairs and decent sized but no mirror, a bit wet for the floor but it's alright, quite a few toilet paper on the floor. Definitely not the worst I've seen but can surely be cleaner or at least smell cleaner. Staff wasn't too friendly and kind of cold but wasn't too rude either. There's a second floor too but the close that up and most chairs are on the tables and organized at later hours..The phone is off the hook at McDonald's the phone in order to order is off the hook duck u, fuck u, fuck u, fuck u, there is it long enough now?"

"Have been coming to Everest since when it was named Rohka (spelling?) So it has to be at least...18 yrs. Love this diner sort of hidden in Chinatown.  Great escape from the Chinese food. Great food, friendly staff. What more can you ask for? when I went to take my daughter there for a burger about a month ago, they were closed and I haven't seen them opened since then. Very sad. I'm hoping it's just for renovations..Another neighborhood diner that I used to go to on the weekends when I was growing up. I usually get the sausage eggs and toast and spend mornings chatting it up. Sad to see that they are closed. Diner was clean and the food was always on point..Strait up dinner in Chinatown. Owner is Greek & his daughter works there some times. The food is exactly what you'd expect but a little fresher, greasier & tastier.  Cops & lots of non-Chinese locals eat here all the time.I love this place - breakfast is best..Sometime I am hankering for a big beefy burger but when I'm in the middle of Chinatown where is a hankering guy to do?My GF remember that Everest makes a great burger.Everest is a hidden little gem of a diner in the middle of Chinatown and have survived for a long time with so many changes going on around them.I lover their burger platter.I got the a huge beef burger is $5.50 + $2 for the deluxe treatment (add tomato, lettuce, fries)The burger taste fresh and not made from a frozen meat paddy. The cold slew is just ok. Rated 4/5Want some cooked onions on the burger? They're happy to add some.The décor is from the late 70s but it is clean.Service is friendly. The owner had time to come out from behind to corner to say hi too..Everest is a great diner located at the edge of Chinatown. It is very close to Police Headquarters and Verizon as well as Murray Burgtram HS so it is your ideal walking distance dinner.Everest has great food which is serviced quickly and courteously. I particularly like the eggs over easy with turkey bacon. But everything I've ever had here is great - including the French toast I am enjoying right now!Owned by a friendly Greek family, you will always be treated warmly!.Good price, suitable portion. We got the meatloaf with peas, corns, mash potatoes. I got the poached eggs with home fries toast and sausages. The toast was very plain, not enough butter. But the meatloaf and the mash potatoes were good. I got the cappuccino and also the aloha smoothie. The smoothie is banana and strawberry combined. I will come back to try the other food..Good placeVery cheapFresh specials everydayOwner is very niceBusy for lunchGood spot for a quick lunch.Not bad diner food. Breakfast is a little expensive. Had a burger the other day which was actually very good.  The service is usually nice and food comes pretty quickly. Small place, quick service and lots of cops inside because it's so close to headquarters & court..A diner in Chinatown? Something I wouldn't expect.There are definitely days where I am craving burgers and such and not Chinese when I'm in Chinatown. And Everest would be that alternative. I've been here for breakfast. The Italian omelet was pretty big. Good place for breakfast in Chinatown if you aren't feeling it for early Dim Dum, which would be me majority of the times har har..$10 for a large feta, spinach omelette breakfast and orange juice. Omelette came with home fries, and two slices of toast. Small place with a few booths and a few tables. It's quite noisy and busy with quick turnover. The staff are just happy, friendly enough, and quick. It's the kind of place I'd regularly go for a big breakfast when I just can't be bothered to cook at home."

"Interesting place for ice cream.got the crazy cookie--vanilla ice cream with oreo cookies and gummy bears, chocolate sprinkles and M&Ms.got the chocolate love--chocolate ice cream with oreo cookies and banana with marshmallows, peanut butter cups and peanuts.TASTY..Four toppings for each cup of rolled ice cream and at only about $7 each its not too bad but the servings could be a bit larger. I had the crazy cookies with Oreos ice cream rolls topped with M&M's. Good for when you're craving a cold sugar rush. It's basically a large kiosk with no seating so you basically grab it to go and walk around the shopping center with it. Plenty of flavor options to choose from.Too me this seems like a fad that was popular a few years ago..This was the worst rolled ice cream i ever had in my life at 42 Years old. The milk tasted very bad & the whipped cream has artificially flavored and tasted disgusting. Made me throw up with a belly ache.... I would not RECOMMEND to anyone.. Poor poor poor.Thai ice cream rolls are a novelty item that have spread in the U.S. the last couple years. Basically, the worker drops a glob of ice cream onto a sub-zero temperature metal plate on the counter, and pushes it around with grill scrapers until rolls of ice cream are formed. He then puts the rolls into a cup, and on the side you choose the toppings (various fruits and nuts and candies). This particular spot is a stand inside the Queens Center Mall. They have 13 different flavors and a good variety of toppings to choose from. However, the ice cream tasted no better than regular ice cream. And the portion was fairly small for $6.43 a cup. Because the cup is so small, expect the topping portions to be stingy too. For example, they cut up one strawberry and put it on top. The reason it is priced at $6.43 is because with tax, it comes out to exactly $7.00..Wanted something cold and refreshing with the bestie since we were melting and burning from all the heat at the mall while shopping around. Thank goodness for Ice Queen Ice Cream because it was just the cold refreshing treat we needed. I ordered the Lychee Ice Cream Rolls with whipped cream and Passion Fruit popping bobba and the bestie got the Caribbean Breeze smoothie. Her smoothie was so refreshing and definitely filled the spot. My ice cream rolls were light perfection. I loved how they were refreshing and not overly sweet. The ultimate treat to end our evening of shopping. We definitely will be coming back to try the other stuff on their menu..This Thai ice cream roll place is soooo awesome. $6.43 for the ice cream (5 rolls in cup) and 4 toppings and whipped cream. Delicious!.First time having Ice Cream rolls. It's really nice that you can see it being made and get to pick 4 toppings on it. Was good. Out of my way since it's in the basement of a busy mall, but I would go again..Was not a fan of it. The first time she made the ice cream it didn't roll out well. She had to scrap it and make another. I ordered just strawberry and it wasn't the best. Perhaps some toppings would've helped, but def not worth the $8.This is my first time having this type of ice cream. Interesting how they make it.  I'm having match a king. My son had monkey business. Both were delicious and refreshing.  Can't wait to try other flavors"

Pros- - comfortable leather semi-reclining seating- screen size, clarity and image quality is top notch - surround sound is spectacular - burger and fries ($15) although served 30Minutes after ordering and cold were good quality, lukewarm fries remained crispy and were packaged nicely Cons - concession is similar to entry level regal/AMC in terms of ordering process and candy/items -size of pop and sodas are very very very very small versus the full AMC/Regal style pricing.  Nobody wants to go for free refills two stories down during a 2 hour movie showing!  AMC/Regal - for the same price -  offer an extra large, large sized drink and a popcorn bucket and a fully reclining leather seat. - Cinepolis  app only shows barcode scan and not the actual ticket showing film title, reserved seats.  We were repeatedly asked for email receipt to supplement the scan.  The app not being that functional is useless; it also doesn't take Apple Pay within its system and asks for a credit number like in the old days; let's get with the time Cinepolis "" luxury theaters ""....- on site staff and management; at time of visit, were not attentive to projecting or providing a "" luxury experience; "" -  the kids working at the check-in point and behind the concession were not knowledgeable of the menu or accommodating when asking menu questions or wanting to omit an ingredient So all and all, clean and renovated theater, comfortable semi-reclining leather seats and terrific surround sound once in the assigned seat within the theater; but subpar concession and overall experience vs price.  The popcorn and soda portions are way too small and overpriced  vs competing theater concepts.    Cinepolis Chelsea is offering a standard ordinary experience that is nowhere near anything of a luxury experience.Cinepolis Chelsea is a solid, good -  yet overpriced  theater if solely judging it for the stunning sound, great picture screen quality and comfortable semi-reclining leather seating - when in the area and no AMC/Regal theaters are around....Came for a 7:00pm showing. Only one concession stand is open, and they don't accept Apple Pay. The escalators don't work. Both rather annoying when your theater is on the third floor and you assume this business is outfitted with typical modern conveniences. The whole place also smells like rancid butter..Love this cinema, not as crowded as other cinemas in the city and has an intimate vibe. The lady at the snacks stand was nice and professional, and the prices were reasonable. We came here to see candyman and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. Love that the seats were well cushioned and even better Could recline with a leg rest, feels like you're in your cinema room at home. I'll always come back here..Nice, low-key theater with luxury seating and a solid food and drink menu. Highly recommended alternative to iPic when that's sold out.Incredible theater. Came here to see F9 on a Sunday afternoon and it was near empty. They definitely need a better sidewalk storefront cause it's not immediately clear they're open, but the inside is beautiful and well kept. The theater itself is three stories and they also have a nice selection of alcoholic beverages, food, and snacks. The seats were really comfortable and overall I had a wonderful time..Went to our first movie since April of 2020 and was really excited to watch the new James Bond Movie.  The experience was horrible due to extremely poor ventilation.   The movie was sold out and all the seats were filled.  One would think that the theatre would at least turn on some sort of AC or fan but instead the theatre was sweltering.  The movie was NOT enjoyable.We definitely won't be going back here anytime soon.  At least not until the theatre figures out how to make their patrons feel comfortable in their establishment..This was my first movie theatre experience since 2019 and I couldn't have picked a better option. The reclining seats make everything so much more enjoyable. I will be back for sure!.Great movie experience and comfortably watched my movie. However, the service was not good. I ordered food about 35 min before the movie started and was told I would receive a text when it was ready. First off, what theater incentivizes receiving texts and going on phone mid movie? Second, I never even got a text. After waiting about 5 min into the movie I decided to check for my food and it was there sitting cold..Comfortable theater to watch In the Heights with recliner seats. But why are all of your escalators not working?  I had to hike up so many flights of stairs? We took the elevator down but it was so slow moving."

"This spot is located  close to a couple hospitals one them being Morgan Stanley Childrens. The food is very good. Already made, buffet style. The staff is pleasant but you have to get your espaniol on lol. Great latin food..This place is right across the street from the school I teach at, And most of the staff go here for lunch. Many of them go here every day for lunch. The food is great, always fresh, and they have new foods all the time..I placed an order for Large mangu with extra cheese and salami. Portion very very small for large mangu. They gv me 2 salami and 2 cheese while I asked for extra cheese & salami. WOW !!! food came cold! Im so disappointed for paying $10 and this what I got! Not to mentioned the pickled onion is very very pale. Wondering if they gv me from previous dayssss !! i wish i can give 0 star !!.So I have a year living in the heights so ocassionally I order mangu tres golpes. Its fried egg, salami, and mashed plantains. Ummm I always ordered from san francisco because the mangu was always good except on the weekends. I noticed on the weekends the lady who is there always has issues with grub hub orders or shes always busy. So yesterday this is how they sent my mangu  I was so upset so i called her and asked her why is the eggs black, she said she packed the order it was from the heat, so i said it looks disgusting and unpresentable i would like to send the picture to a manager she said the phones dont take picture, and for me to tell her what i have to say because shes very busy. I said i just wanted to tell you you should not send people mangu like that ? She responded that if you want come in ill give you another plate. Ummmm No thank you. I paid delivery to have this sent to me why should I come to you ? And, I paid you for this service again why should I come to your establishment? So they lost a customer and there goes the mangu you guys through in a plate and sent out !.Excellent food and service l.  Had a large Sancocho, so damn good, perfect for a cool day..San Francisco Restaurant #2 is just as good as the mother restaurant. The service is impeccable and the warm hospitality will bring you back to the charming thoughts of Dominican people. The buffet style ready food is always fresh, delicious and good for anyone on the rush for some delicious food. Fresh made natural juices and desserts are delicious. The ""Sancocho"" is always one of the best that I've tried in New York City. Feel free to ask for what are the specials that they could prep for you, they will always accommodate any special requests that you might have. I can not emphasize how good this restaurant is...give it a try and be the judge of the flavors that will take over your taste buds and transport you to paradise..The food & drinks are superb...nice varieties of food to choose from...definitely, a must try!"

"My go-to place for Korean comfort food. Fast and easy grab and go delicious rice cakes, fish cake and more..They're located on the first level, on the left hand side when you enter the food court. I noticed how good their tteokbokki looked from other customers' trays, so I got what I thought would be the best of both worlds: Combo A, which had both kimbap and tteokbokki ($12.25). I picked bulgogi for my kimbap, which comes with 10 pieces. What I failed to realize, which wasn't clear from their signs, is that the tteokbokki in their combos come in a very small sized cup, rather than the regular black bowls. If it was clear, I would've ordered a full sized bowl of tteokbokki to go with my kimbap, as I would rather skip the disposable small cup and have the regular bowl. The kimbap goes great when dipped in the tteokbokki sauce, hence why the regular bowl would've been a great pairing. You order first and pay and wait for the pager to alert you when your order is ready for pick up. There's seating downstairs, but with several businesses on the first floor, you're better off heading up for more seating if the first floor is all full..I was in the food court checking out places and tried this one out. I ordered the spicy rice cakes, it was incredibly mediocre.While the sauce was spicy, it also tasted a touch too sweet and was way too thick. The rice cakes themselves were ok. But the sauce was just not that good. I'll likely pass on this stand next time..Kimbap tasted awful. It was falling apart and the flavor was bad, I ended up eating just the rice and egg part. I also got the cup of ddukbokki which was okay, I think the bad kimbap ruined the meal. I know businesses are trying their best but cannot recommend this place. E-mo kimbap across the street tastes much better and is well made..3 instead of 4 stars because of the price. I ordered the regular portion size (instead of the cup size) spicy rice cake and one order of the black sausage. Two of these combined were good to share between two people. The rice cake was on the sweeter side, not overly spicy, came with plenty of fish cake inside - overall pretty good. The black sausage was good too but way too small for $12... I think that's unreasonably high -- this is a food court!.I love this place. It's located ibsyde the Korean food  gallery 32. So happy they are open again! All my favorites are here. Bulgogi Kim bop for $9 comes w soup. Spicy rice cake. Service is fast. Perfect for picking up lunch. I try not to go often to the Korean food gallery n I  would definitely gain weight. This  place is a must for a quick Korean street food fix..My go-to kimbap place (E-MO) has really weird hours and aren't open half the time I swing by ktown. I'm as really craving kimbap so I decided to order the bulgogi kimbap from here. It was so disappointing, I didn't even finish it tossed the rest out..One of the many stalls in the Food Gallery. I always see their kimbaps so I decided to try the shrimp tempura kimbap with the rice cake combo. My bf got the same combo but with bulgogi. The meal is very filling. I will say that both the shrimp tempura and bulgogi were overcooked. The shrimp was a little too hard and the beef was very dry. There were a lot of veggies and yet both lacked flavor. I can't pinpoint why exactly but maybe because we weren't given any soy sauce with our order to dip...The rice cakes were ok. Very much on the sweeter side. The sauce tastes like carrot puree. The actual rice cakes were a little too gummy and a little undercooked. Not sure if this stall compares to the others so might not go back..Found this place to order through Seamless for lunch.  Prices for the food are decent but for how it actually tastes probably not so much.  I ordered the fried dumpling, fried vegetables and bulgogi kimbap.  The fried food tasted stale and almost like a day old - just wasn't fresh at all.  The bulgogi meat in the kimbap tasted more like minced meat and was very crumbly - was not very fresh either.  Given all of the other options in Ktown I'd try something else than come here again..There were some combos that seemed impressive but that might not be ideal for a long haul on the PATH, so I went for the spicy pork and spicy tuna kimbaps. While the tuna was a more assertive main ingredient, the pork version was more of an ensemble piece. Why isn't burdock root more famous?"

"tl;dr a pastel truck, stationed outside the Broad to fulfill your ice cream dreamsMy mother and I happened to be leaving the Broad, when lo-and-behold, the much-touted ice cream truck Van Leeuwen was stationed just across the street. It must have just arrived, as the server was still organizing the signs in front the of the truck's side window.The guy was patient and generous, offering us large, mix-in-filled samples of 4 flavors: Tiki Paradise, Brown Sugar, Pear Tart, and Strawberry Rhubarb. The Tiki Paradise was sherbet featuring some lesser-known tropical flavors, like guava. The brown sugar, on the other hand, had a somewhat gritty texture and a subtle, neutral flavor, perfect for toppings or sundaes. The Pear Tart exhibited a subtle fruit flavor and was chalked full of poached pears and graham cracker crust mix-ins. Similarly, the Strawberry Rhubarb was generously filled with homemade jam and granola crumble. We ended up choosing the latter two flavors, and the server offered us a sugar cone each on the side.At $7.50 for two, modest-sized scoops, Van Leeuwen is admittedly on the expensive side. But with delicious, sophisticated flavors, and half of each scoop being taste- and texture-laden mix-ins, this is definitely among the elite ice creameries in the city..First time in a Van Leeuwen ice cream scoop shop. I've tried the brown sugar chunk from a Whole Foods but never a fresh scoop from a shop. I ordered the peanut butter chocolate chunk, and vegan chocolate brownie. These were both good. I wanted to try the other flavors but they were sold out of the main ones I'd wanted, which was pretty disappointing. They were out of the normal brownie chocolate and the brown sugar chunk. Also cookies and cream was gone. My brother tried the vegan birthday cake which was the flavor of the month and that was pretty good. You do get the taste of the coconut milk or non dairy milk that it's made with but it's still a good texture. Pricey ice cream but what ice cream in La isn't....Read the reviews where folks said the got sick after eating here AFTER ordering haha so let's hope it's not a common thing and we're good  vegan mint chip with vegan whip and double scoop pb with fudge.Ice cream trucks are always welcome but Van Leeuwen is in its own class. The menu was rather expansive with a range of flavors including vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, salted caramel, mint chip, and the hallmark honeycomb. After sampling a few of the flavors, we opted for a double scoop of mint chip and pistachio. The pistachio, while devoid of nut pieces, was creamy and delectable. Each bite mimicked the actual pistachio flavor. The mint chip, meanwhile, was refreshing and not too sweet. Servings were also very generous, with a single scoop basically amounting to a double..Van leeuwen is a food truck that is essentially an ice cream parlor on wheels. It reminds me of ice cream trucks when I was a kid only more sophisticated fun. It was across the street from The Broad but also in the same proximity of the contemporary art museum. In big bold lettering it read ICE CREAM & VEGAN ICE CREAM across the top of the truck which is what caught my eye. I spotted it from across the street and I fancied ice cream instantly so ice cream is what I got.They had more regular flavors then vegan and that was to be expected. However, the flavors they did have were pretty awesome. There was only one other person in front of me and one person behind me so I was able to get a sample. I sampled the pistachios and the pumpkin spice. Oh dear, both flavors were amazing! I could have gotten one of each but then again I thought one was suffice. I ordered a single scoop pumpkin spice (and everything nice, I just wanted to say that last bit lol). Anywho,I ordered my sister a single scoop vanilla. She didn't even sample it, she just knew that vanilla was calling her name lol. One vegan vanilla and One vegan pumpkin spice ice cream cones please, I conveyed to the man and he nicely began putting everything together. He was nice and friendly. The scoops were generous and sturdy--just what we were looking for! I look forward to the vegan Sundae my next visit! YUMMY        ""Love the Life you Live. Live the Life you Love!""                                                                   -Bob Marley.Van Leeuwen.  From outside the Broad to downtown LA, your ice cream has always been irresistible.  Your customer service and workers have always been engaging, happy, willing to answer any questions, as repetitive it may be.  Until now.  Specifically at this location here in Venice while I was with my friend who has never had your ice cream.  Convinced with my high praises of your ice cream, he wanted to give it a try.  Let me replay the conversation for you.Me: ""Hi!  Can we get a sample of the vanilla and the matcha?""Worker: ""Uh, sorry we kind of have a line, so I can't do that right now""Me: ""Oh.. ok.""  I ask my friend, ""Do you know what you want?""  Of course he doesn't.  He tries to quickly skim the menu to make a decision.Worker:  ""Why don't you come back later, when you know what you want, because we have a line.""Let me show you a picture of the line.  Four.  Fucking.  People.  We're not asking samples of the whole truck.  At Salt and Straw, if the customer wanted to be THAT person and sample all 20+ of their flavors, they'd let you.  And the long ass line outside can and will wait.  If they can wait, I'm sure that the four people lined up at your truck can wait an extra minute.  Regardless of all that, if a customer wants a sample, you fucking give them a sample.It's like saying, ""Oh, credit card?  My machine ran out of paper.. I got some in the cupboard but uh, there's a long line waiting.  Do you have cash?  There's an ATM there, if you want.""Like what the hell?  I'm never triggered by lackluster food, weird ambiance of establishments, etc.  What I am triggered about is people like this who don't do their job properly.  Let the high school students and immigrants who need a job serve us delicious ice cream instead- ride your skateboard to the mall and get a job serving pretzels- nothing to sample there, and no line either..A lovely afternoon treat. I found this truck parked directly across the Broad Museum. $5.50 || 1 scoop$7.50 || 2 scoops$9.50 || 3 scoopsStaff was nice to let me sample different flavors before making up my mind. I opted for 2 flavors: Earl Grey Tea and Matcha. (The scoops are generous!)Earl Grey Tea Review:My favorite of the two. Satin smooth & delightfully aromatic. The earl grey flavor is bold and the light sweetness entertains your taste buds. I would get this again :)Matcha Review:Unique vegan ice cream choice! The luxuriously creamy cashew milk flavor really shines. I didn't get as much of an earthy matcha leaf taste as I expected. This would be perfect for folks who aren't so partial to plain matcha tea, but are willing to give it another try..It's good but it is too sweet for me. If the ice cream is a out 50% less sugar, it would be perfect. I like their creations, the flavors and essence is there but usually... I couldn't take more than 3 spoonfuls of their ice cream. Oh by the way, its $5.50 per scoop. Quite pricey on the ice cream dessert size. Great for sharing though, just enough for that sugar craving.We got the peanut butter and it's pretty good. This location is located next to silverlake ramen. The parking is not free... its $6 valet on a friday night. Street parking is very limited! Be warn!.My brain, walking by truck on street: ""What?! Vegan ice cream!""5 seconds later, two women, doing the same walk by: ""*Gasp* vegan ice cream!""I spotted the Van Leeuwen truck on Abbot Kinney boulevard in Venice on a recent Saturday afternoon just a block from Salt & Straw, a traditional ice creamery hotspot which had a line out the door. I was much more excited to try Van Leeuwen's non-dairy version, given that I only drink almond and cashew milk because since a few years ago, dairy upsets my stomach.The vegan ice cream was better than I imagined: extremely creamy and delicately sweet! There were about eight all-vegan, non-GMO flavors available including coffee, salted caramel, dark chocolate, vanilla. I tried a sample of pistachio and then got a cone with two flavors: roasted banana with walnuts and mint chocolate chip. This was NOT soy ice cream, so it didn't have that weird soy flavor and tasted more like dairy ice cream, as instead of milk they use coconut and cashew milk (cashews are naturally a little sweet). They also use raw cocoa butter and extra virgin coconut oil, organic sugar cane with no stabilizers, fillers, gums and ""natural flavors"". The best part of the vegan ice cream was no bloating or upset stomach. It was just a very creamy, tasty treat!They also have classic, dairy ice cream made with milk, cream, cane sugar and egg yolks and no binders or artificial ingredients.You can get a cone or cup with 1-2 flavors for $6 (or $5.50 for non-vegan version) and $2 more for 3 flavors. They also have massive sundaes with their own sauces such as their housemade caramel (I am not sure if the caramel is vegan though)..So I see the truck outside the Broad. Three hours plus until dinner. Should I?  Yes, I shall. Small cup of ginger and pistachio ice creams. The ginger was spectacular. If you love candied ginger, oh, how you will love this splendiferous creation. The pistachio, while a nice ice cream, did not at all taste of pistachios. Not. One. Iota.So to sum it up, I am sad that I did not order two scoops of that ginger wonderfulness. That in itself deserves the fifth star that its pistachio partner killed."
"Solid and affordable Park Slope sushi joint. While not the tastiest nor the best sushi I've ever had, the service and quality was on par with the price. Can't ask for much more.I would recommend any roll with shrimp tempura, as that was the star of the show.I'll consider coming back for the Hibachi next time..Great place and excelente food. They have a good show, the chef interacts with the costumers. You can have sake and catch a piece of zucchini..Beware of roaches!!! This was our second consecutive Sunday coming here. What attracted us were the pricees but that does not make up for the service. We were a party of three for the hibachi and right off the bat the waitress informed us that if another party came we were going to be asked to move!! Why should we? We were the only customers there, we should have first dibs at the best seats. That's not the best part. Halfway thru the show i saw a ROACH on one of the sauce plates!!!  They kindly removed the plates and the roach. 5 minutes later there was another roach crawling on the floor in the same area. This is unacceptable. Got a 20% discount off bill but I couldn't eat my meal. Won't be back ever..I'm afraid I have to add to the negative reviews. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt I needed to warn people about this place. Like many, I made a reservation for hibachi to celebrate a birthday - my son's 11th. He had his friends there, all of them 10 or 11 years old. I made a reservation for 4:30. We got there at 4:25. At 4:50, they took our order, and at 5:30, the chef finally came. At various points in that hour, I was told that the delay had to do with 1. us being late (not true), 2. the chef being late (I think this was true), and 3. the other chef called in sick (I don't think this was true). Knowing that many people reserve for birthdays, the management should really consider getting a back up chef in case there is actually more than one reservation at 4:30.We had come from a Mets game, and the very active kids were starving by the time we sat down. We got through a whole hour of waiting and whining, but as I told the hostess, my son only has one 11th birthday, and the restaurant did nothing to make it a good memory. I do not go for the food. The seafood is chemically preserved and not fresh, and the rest is mediocre. I go because my son likes the chef's antics, which is why one of the other solutions the hostess offered wouldn't have worked - to have food cooked in the kitchen and brought out..The 50% off Sushi was definitely the draw for this place. Walked in and saw that this place wasn't as busy as it should be for the discount they were offering up.I asked for hot tea not relaizing that they charge $1. Scanned the menu. Specialty rolls were buy 2, get 1 free. Don't be fooled though, at an average of $12 a roll, the 3 rolls still come out to $8 each. Plus an additional charge of $1 per roll for brown rice--not cool. Although it was nice to have sashimi pieces for $1 each (check the menu).Service was alright. We ordered asking for brown rice on the rolls and were given white rice. I was acknowledged for a tea refill but had to ask a second time. Having left paying $25 for dinner, I definitely could have had better..The services was great and so was the food. I ordered the Filet Mignon Hibachi and my girlfriend got the salmon teriyaki..So I came here to show some family from out of town a good time with some habachi and sushi. The food arrived so i proceeded to eat it. All of a sudden, I stabbed my mouth on a piece of bone in my sushi...............enough said. The end..My first hibachi restaurant. Cool experience...the chef was entertaining. Awesome aim with throwing broccoli into our mouths lol. (I missed mine though) I had the chicken hibachi. It was pretty good. Also like others mentioned, the sushi is 50% off. I was skeptical about that because when anything says 50% off I worry about the quality or I think something is wrong with it, BUT to my surprised I really liked my sushi...and I'm not even a big sushi fan. It was also inexpensive, definitely a good spot to go to if you're on a budget.I didnt like that it was so dim in there though, but I guess thats supposed to add to whole hibachi ambiance and having fire in front of your face..Here's what I'm gathering from the majority of the reviews: sushi - not so great. Hibachi - so. Much. Freaking. Fun. As you might have guessed from my four stars, I had the pleasure of ordering hibachi.We seriously had a blast. I can't say enough good things and I wish I remembered our chef's name. We were a party of five with two wee ones and they thought the whole spectacle was riveting and hilarious. Of course the big kids' favorite part was when he shot sake in our mouths... On THAT note, we couldn't believe how affordable the beer and sake was. Food was delicious (the fried rice was seriously addictive) and the chef was entertaining and obscenely talented. Can't complain.Never ever assume you're too old to giggle uncontrollably when your hibachi chef makes an onion volcano or a Spongebob Ricepants or says, ""Mmm...chicken. Meow meow."".Stopped in for a snack and the rolls were so good it turned into a meal! The rolls are super yummy and only cost two bucks!! The spicy rolls are great and they also have really good ginger. Went in with a hangover and left feeling totally cured! :) plus the staff is super friendly and nice.YUM"

"This restaurant has been around for at least 10 years. I hadn't ordered from them for a long time because the food was too dry and not very tasty. Well, they must have a new chef or cooks and new staff because all the meals I've ordered recently have been the most delicious Chinese food I've had in years. The food is now very tasty and not dry or overcooked as before. The first 2 times I ordered by delivery services. Today I ordered by phone for pickup. I asked how long and was surprised when the woman said ""5 Minutes "" .  It's only 5 long blocks from my job but it was very cold outside so I drove there, and my food was already bagged and ready when I got there within 6 minutes.  I drove back and opened my food which was hot. All the utensils and sauces were included along with a can of soda. All for $8.25 for Pork Lo Mein with pork fried rice. Again, the food was delicious.  I recommend anybody to try them now. They're making consitently great food without long waits. No more bland food from the other Chinese restaurants I was trying. Thank you New Hot Wok staff..As the other reviewers have stated, the service isn't anything to write home about. That being said, it's a takeout type place and I don't come here for fine dining or top-notch service. The lady at the counter won't say hello, she'll just ask you what you want. Don't get me wrong, I'm big on service, but sometimes you recognize a place/business for what it is. My main focus is on the food. I want it to be good and it is. I've gotten the Shrimp Mei Fun, Pork Mei Fun and chicken wings. The portion sizes are good, I can get three meals out of the Mei Fun dishes and the food is fresh. I've never ordered on the phone so I can't speak on that but I know they use Uber Eats and some other food delivery service..Just ordered the small shrimp firerice, however, it is worth the larger value. The shrimp tasted very fresh. Try ate it with the duck sauce. Best choice..Very rude customer service. No type of greeting or salutations on the phone. Just plain ole nasty.  Will NOT order from then again. Poor service leads to poor business. Simple..The prices aren't that bad but the service is less to be desired. Not a place I would recommend."
"Breakfast wraps are the bomb!  Great selection of ice cream pints for the late night munchies!.Straightforward NYC deli.  No frills, but great selection of drinks and lunch/dinner items.  Got the pastrami sandwich for 6.95, comes with free pickle, chips and a soda.Great value, can't complain. Service was quick; I'll definitely be back again.Service is as expected, no problems here either..Gross, disgusting. Overpriced abs rude, I try to support local business but this guy is not helping himself, then he complains when a chain coffee shop takes over..Horrible service and horrible food. Went in at 2:15am and asked for a chicken quesadilla. Got cold chicken on a cold tortilla and after spending $11 and asking to at least warm up and told ""they're busy""Rude services, terrible food. Save your money and eat the garbage outside.Terrible, terrible! Ordered a Philly cheesesteak and basically received a piece of bread and cheese. See image...Called and said I was disappointed and was told my sub looks like this because I opted out of adding on peppers and onions. Gimme a break!.the owner has horrible customer service! rude and disrespectful! i ordered over the phone and when they got the bread incorrect he said it was my fault! he also said it wasnt his problem that i messed up the order. refused to give me a refund or even make it the way i wanted! i will never go here again, even the turkey was old and gray looking!!.Was looking for a quick, inexpensive lunch and Amsterdam Deli did not disappoint! The combo meal (burger, fries, and a can of soda) came to ~$9 after tax and included a lot of food! Fries were solid too.I had the veggie burger (although you can choose a beef or turkey burger as well), and while it didn't look homemade it hit the spot. Full of veggies and slightly crisp from the grill. Not a black bean burger which is a positive for me. Will be back!.Best bodega / deli in the neighborhood. Come here all the time for the chicken Caesar wrap and the chicken quesadilla is out of this world. Both are under $11 and come with a soda and big enough portions to share. Don't believe the bad reviews. This place is the tits and I look forward to trying other food items.Corner deli that offers a wide selection of food breakfast through dinner.  I  particularly enjoy the make-your-own pasta combo along with the hot bar, which typically serves up chicken, pepper steak, salmon, pasta along with several vegetable sides.  Their burger and fries and philly cheese combos are pretty decent.  They also offer fresh salad options.  A bit pricy, especially post renovation, and delivery takes awhile..Been ordering from here during Covid-19, and they consistently take too long for delivery.  Although the prices are reasonable, it might be my last time due to this."
"I had decided to purchase Halal food from this restaurant because it had remained open during later hours and I didn't want to travel back home on an empty stomach. I was astonished to discover that chapli was available to which I had selected it over rice. The preparation time was minimal and I was impressed with the attention toward cleanliness in this particular restaurant. All the staffs wore their masks properly and the hand sanitizer dispenser worked. I appreciated that the chapli was cooked until crunchy, but not to the extent where it was burned and the rice was soft. However, I deducted a star because the meal seemed overpriced, but I would return again because the food quality and customer service were notable..Great spot, good food. Chicken and lamb are tasty. Open late throughout the night and included South Asian drinks and desserts. Needs to be cleaner though. Found a rubber band in my gyro....BeWare it no longer serves food of quality ... The management is horrible and they serve old and dried lamb over rice and have raised prices ... The food is no worth the money ... and when u question there quality they ask u to go and shop at a different gyro spot ... what a pathetic way to run business ... They either need to change the staff or spend some more money to serve fresh food ... shitty place.We like to pick up their entrees and have it by the beach.   There food are made fresh and are tasty.  The establishment is small but clean.  The staff are friendly and respectful; in addition they are affordable.  There lamb chops are  worth trying..Came here to grab a chicken tikka masala bc I've been craving it with, had it with rice only and no salad. First of all what I got was grilled cubed chicken breasts, where is the sauce it should be swimming in? The chicken was under cooked and very dry, the rice was cold and over seasoned tasting nasty. They shouldn't be selling chicken tikka masala when they clearly don't know what or how to make it!!! Waste of money for garbage food!!! And why do they give a side of bbq sauce lol?!.""Mamma, don't let your babies grow up to eat Gyro's"" Middle eastern soul food for $5.  How do they do it?It might be a little over-seasoned or not the highest quality product but, they deliver a monstrous filling one that's incredibly tasty with all the oil you will need for the week. So, if you have lost all sense of healthy reasoning and have no idea what holiday it is, this is the place you might want to stop at..The gyro was not how I wanted it the owner didn't care about how I wanted my food because he didn't listen to absolutely nothing I said !! And when I asked him if he can do it over all he did was ignore me I'm never coming back to this establishment again oh yea and the food was trash.I love this place ! I'm on the Keto Diet so it's a great option for a meal quick. I literally eat here at lunch or late nights they are open. The chicken is super delicious and fresh always spiced well . And the veggies are crispy and fresh ..Guys. I never had service like this. Super polite. I order fried fish , the guy gave me 4 P.! With a drink for $6!How can you argue?5 star quick snack.A small little spot. The gyro was pretty good. Nice size chunks of meat with fresh veggies and the pita bread was spot on. Customer Service was great as the owner gave me a free drink with my gyro. If ever I'm back in Brooklyn I'll be sure to come again."
"Food is AMAZING!!!!!!! Very fresh, filling, tasty, and a great value! One of my favorite pizza places in Bushwick hands down.syqwyt-7pebNo-humjes.I hate leaving negative reviews, I usually avoid it - especially during a pandemic when everyone's trying to get by.But this is ridiculous.$16.19 for pasta primavera that has two pieces of broccoli, a couple of mushroom pieces, and what amounts to not even a slice of tomato. They seriously added some parsley to make it look greener???It's dry; there's a bit of water at the bottom but it's 100% not garlic/oil because it tastes like nothingness. Almost $20 for this is an absolute insult, on top of a waste of money. They should be ashamed of themselves, trying to pull this off as pasta primavera..This is definitely the best pizza shop in the area if you're looking for traditional NY pizza. They live up to the name crust because this is the only pizza where I eat the crust, it's soft yet crunchy. The pepperoni & margherita slices are my favorites. The owner is super nice and talks to everyone who enters, he even offers to make specialty pizzas if you'd like. The owner says he can make anything, so I'm looking forward to taking him up on that offer!.You must order pizza from here! So many delicious options! The margarita pizza blew me away! Staff is also so friendly!.Delicious pizza and friendly staff. This guilty pleasure is worth a visit. I like their plain slice but my husband loves their chicken francese dish..Ordered a large cheese with extra sauce- didn't check the pie at the restaurant but i live really close and the pizza was basically cold but the box was warm. Had to pop it back in my own oven. After i got it hot, the pizza tasted great. Just wish i had gotten it hot as it's supposed to be because i paid for it to be hot AND tasty.Tried Crust on a whim one night after looking for new pizza places to try. Boy am I glad I found them! The ingredients are so fresh and tasty and the crust is perfect. A great pizza spot in Bushwick that is a must try that will leave you wanting more..Amazing pizza from Crust. The ingredients taste so fresh and it is thin and crispy. My new go-to spot for sure..We had a really great takeout experience from Crust. We tried a garlic knots crust, eggplant pizza and it was fantastic! It's really a ton of food but it's delicious and fun. We also got some penne ala vodka every was tasted great and felt homemade..Nice pizza in a great location. But only one big problem , GUYS please smile!!Looks so sad inside. You guys making the best food ever !!Pls be happy :)Sad employed  cannot make happy pizza..Crust offers huge slices, deliciously chewy crust, and the best slice of ny pizza in the area!  Delivery is friendly and prompt. I highly recommend a Binaca slice! (White pizza with glorious lumps of ricotta)"
"I have been looking for fresh baked goods, especially my favorite quiche. Parva Bakershop made my wish come true. Always come for buttery seeded wheat bun, croissants, and sandwiches. They will be my go to place for quite long time..This bakery is an awesome addition to Jackson Heights. Only been here a few times but I need to be a regular. The coffee and all the drinks are always on point, but the food definitely exceeded my initial expectations. One of my favorites so far is the Egg Whites with Avocado and Spinach on Multigrain Bread! If you're ever around check them out. I'm definitely making it a point to go this week..SKIP THE DINER, breakfast at Parva is the way to go.Cute, clean, delicious Ordered iced rose-mora and a chai tea latte, both delicious. You can't go wrong with any breakfast item honestly, they all look amazing. The egg white sandwich in particular is one of the best breakfast sandwiches I ever had sans any processed meat yet still tasted super filling and flavorful. The entire menu seems to be on the 'healthier' side and it's totally welcoming in the neighborhood that only had the signature bacon, egg, and cheese for so long. Def want to try more items in the future.Staff is really kind and energetic and you feel good starting your day here. I assume if if you're doing your laundry here you'll feel extra productive..I stopped by 82nd street and wondered into Parva because they always have such great pastries, but today I decided to break the pattern of indulgent goodies and opt for a healthy breakfast.  This meant I waked in bravely to try their multigrain avocado on a roll, and no doubt, it was so good.  The fresh tomato, the lime juice on the avocado, the crisp yet lightness of the bread, etc.  I could go on.  I love it so much!  I highly recommend it.  I also had brought home the wonderful Southern style banana creme pie in a jar and it is absolutely phenomenal!  It's super delicious and just a great dessert for a summer day..This is a nice bakery that opened recently on Northern Blvd.  It shares space with aquarelo and it's has a great family feel.  The space is cozy and has a few tables and a couple of communal tables with stools.  It has plenty of window providing sunlight while you have your coffee.  My favorite beverage has been the cortado.  I look forward to trying more the baked goods.  I have already tried the foccacia which was covered in rosemary and had a nice freshness to it.  The second time, I had ordered the almond croissant which was nice and sweet. It had a crunch and inside had a sweet filling.  Both were delicious.  I bought a maracuya cheese danish for my child, who loved it. I found the ladies at the counter friendly and welcoming.  I highly recommend taking some time to visit and have a coffee or tea..Part three (the finale) of the empanada adventure last week.Mama's Empanadas and Empanada spot had issues with employees with masks use. The walk down to Parva was few blocks. At this point, I was feeling like any baked good would do. Parva had a great almond croissant and guava twist the last time we had stopped by very close to its opening. We got in line with 3-4 people ahead of us.Surprisingly, they have empandas too. I was looking at the selection of 4 styles of empandas as the lady behind the counter stood up with a tray of baked goods she was pulling out the replenish the counter. She was breathing heavily through her nose - the one part that did NOT have her mask covering.  My enhanced senses could just see all the microscopic fluid particles covering the food. Thanks but no thanks. It's been over a year, sigh, I guess I'll get an empanada in 2022. Minus 2 stars since this is still a health safety issue. If you find a bakery or empanada place that has decent health standards please let me know..Walked over here early on a Saturday morning with most of the outside seating already taken. Go inside and place your order and they'll bring the food out to wherever you're sitting.Decided on a large Iced Latte ($5) and a Bacon Egg and Cheese on an everything bagel ($7). Order comes out about 15-20 minutes later - a well toasted bagel with all the necessary fillings. Easy to eat as none of the inside fell out after the first bite. Iced Latte was more milky than expected but kept me awake for the rest of the day.Waitress here was friendly and helpful with the menu items. Despite being on a bustling street, worth going for an early morning meal..These people are way too over priced they charged me 14$ for a crossont bacon egg and cheese with avocado it's seriously ridiculous how over priced these people are for a small sandwich.I love this place their bacon egg and cheese is so good and their orange juice is the best i've ever had im defenetly coming back here again.Came here today and ordered avocado toast the bread it came with was way too thick the eggs should always be served with sunny side up on a avocado toast but they made it scrambled  instead and it was dry i was disappointed how the egg was made..I stopped by Parva on my work the other day, and I got their bacon egg and cheese with smashed avocado on a sesame bagel, almond croissant and a ice coffee with oat milk. It did take a few minutes to get my food, but it was worth the wait. The breakfast sandwich was absolutely delicious. I usually get my bagels toasted, but I didn't have to with Parva. Even with it not being toasted, it was hot, chewy and airy at the same time. The addition of avocado definitely made a huge difference. Their almond croissant was absolutely delicious as well. It had a nice layer of almond paste inside and it was huge! I'm already looking forward to the next time I come here..One of my top 3 favorite cafes in queens! So thankful to my friend who lived in the neighborhood for a bit who raved to me about it. My go-to's here are the almond croissant, the chocolate croissant, occasionally their specialty cheesecake croissant AND their egg white sandwich on a multigrain croissant sandwich. That multigrain croissant sandwich, with spinach, avocado, cheese and tomato, is a godly creation. Super well done. My absolute favorite breakfast sandwich!.Back again for their seasonal horchata latte. Everything is made in house, great selection of milks and the friendliest kindest staff! Overall win for the neighborhood..This place is a local and Latino owned business and I am happy to support both. They use quality ingredients and add Latin twists to classic coffee/brunch spots. (I.e they had chorizo quiche on their special board today). I got an iced coffee with oat milk and it was made perfectly, to order and the coffee was smooth, and not bitter. My only hangup is that they do t have sugar-free flavored syrup options, but the coffee was good it didnt need it."
"The food is so tasty. This is how I remember Chinese takeout tasting! I don't have decent takeout spots in my neck of the neighborhood so I order it here after work and take it home and it's worth it..Fresh , tasty American Chinese comfort food. Ordered multiple times and will continue to do so..Double Delight aims to please by always accommodating my annoying off menu requests.  I requested eggplant and string bean in garlic sauce combo platter with veggie fried rice. I was delighted that my order came out perfectly.  Also they have ketchup packets during a national shortage!.Tried this place the other night after hearing good things . Honestly it was just ok. Beef with broccoli was very bland as was fried rice . Egg roll was very good . My son enjoyed his boneless spareribs . I expected better though.You can't trust Yelp for honest reviews! It had steered me wrong many times! This place isn't 4 stars  all, y""all need to experience great food instead of settling for blah food. So disappointed when you go by reviews and the food is dreadful.We ordered from here on a whim yesterday, because I've been on the hunt for better chicken and broccoli.  8 months pregnant and I'm not playing around.  If I want chicken and broccoli, I'm gonna find it, and eat it mostly myself.We got for starters the wonton in spicy peanut sauce; chicken and broccoli for me, and hubby got a beef chow fun - oh, and I needed an egg roll, so we got that too.Grubhub said it would be about 40 minutes to deliver, so I was fine with that, but we got our order literally 15 minutes later!  Talk about service!The egg roll was completely old school - you know what I mean - BIG and loaded with pieces of roasted beef and NOT greasy!  I could've eaten two myself it was that good!  The wonton with spicy peanut sauce was really good!  Very savory and tasted similar to cold sesame noodles; pretty much the same sauce, with a little kick at the end.  An unexpectedly tasty starter!The chicken and broccoli was the BEST I've had in a long time.  No weird aftertaste; no hard broccoli that can be replanted in the ground.  This was truly delicious and will be my go-to dish when we order again in the very near future.The beef chow fun was beef chow YUM!  The beef was tender and juicy, while the broad noodles were light and airy.  This was a total 10/10!I can't rave about this place enough!  This will be our go-to place for a while!.I've been trying to find a solid chinese food take out spot... the 2 other chinese food restaurants I love are either closed or just too expensive for what I get so I decided to try something new. This restaurant is efficient, quick, and food comes nice and hot. Everything was correct and they read my order notes (I've had bad online ordering luck lately so this made me add an extra star). Solid food spot you get a lot of food for the price and it's edible! Since I have food for the next few days I'll prob throw in some msg for more flavor. Sweet and sour pork lunch: sweet and sour comes separate from the fried pork which was nice because the pork didn't come soggy. The sweet and sour sauce is standard I do wish it came with peppers,onions, and pineapple. Would've had better flavor. General tso chicken lunch: I've never had this dish before I always thought it came spicy so I never tried. I added in the notes to make it less spicy and didn't notice any spice at all. I thought I would like his dish more since it's in the majority of reviews but not bad... but not amazing. Thought the sauce would have more flavor. House special lo mein: This was actually my favorite dish I haven't had lo mein for a long time and this hit the spot. Good flavor..They made me wait three hours for food that they claim to have delivered. I stood outside waited and they never showed up but said they did. The most pathetic place to order food from. Makes me want to delete the yelp app all together.peace is shit Chinese place..Received my order in FIFTEEN MINUTES, and I live at least 10 minutes away with traffic! AMAZING! I have always loved their food and to have them deliver so quickly is just a big bonus, A+ delivery service.Sesame chicken was still crispy, crab rangoons hot and crunchy, chicken wings flavorful..Good was ok but I ordered steak with garlic sauce I had 6 tiny pieces the size of the beef in the beef and broccoli probably was the beef and the food wasn't bad there just skimpy"
"The food here is really yummy and affordable! They gave us free bread which was really delicious. Great atmosphere and clean restaurant..Have been waiting in the restaurant for a takeout order from an hour ago, just standing here and they are telling me they will always serve dine in customers over any takeout. Please wait for another 5 minute..Quite dissapointed at this restaurant, I've ordered takeout before for the noodle and remembered it being pretty good... today I decided to come in for a dine in experience and was dissapointed in most if not all the dishes... the wonton in spicy oil (hung yau chow sau) was a watery mess with siracha on top... if anyone knows this dish it's suppose to be wonton in spicy chili oil... sans siracha and water.. I ate one and couldn't do anymore... the beef noodles portion was big for $9 but it was only okay... and my friend ordered the Taiwanese beef pepper steak... and the sauce was sweet ... not exactly what we were used to. The service was good and efficient and the steak comes with  toasted bread covered in thousand island which was pretty good... one star for service one star for the bread.And I came back for their steaks.Although their store was small, the inside was modern and well decorated. I enjoyed the cow theme. They even had cow videos on TV! As we ordered steak.After seeing the thumbs up on their menu and a friend's review, we got the Black Pepper Steak over White Rice ($10.95) and also the Black Pepper Sirloin Steak ($20.95).Right after ordering, we were hit with free salad, garlic bread, and not even 20 seconds in, the Black Pepper Steak over White Rice. It was to the point my boyfriend needed some time to analyze how in the world it came out so quick. Although the steak was only slightly hot, it was BOMB and full of black pepper aroma. So flavorful, more than I soon learned my Black Pepper Sirloin Steak was going to be.Not long after, the Black Pepper Sirloin Steak came in sizzling inside a covered lid. Like an American vs Chinese dish, I enjoyed my broccoli while my boyfriend had his bok choy. Although my dish didn't have much pasta, I was still full as the focus was more on their steak, which was a nice medium rare (could have been more red!). Both of our meats were so tender. Honestly, although not as nicely presented, the steak over rice was a fat bang for your buck. Definitely get that!This is a true hidden gem with great food and fast friendly service. I can't wait to go back to try more of their dishes..I am totally coming back to dine in for their steak!I wandered upon this restaurant spontaneously one day on Uber Eats, after needing a quick lunch to quiet my hungry stomach. Not quite feeling meat that day, I opted for a Seafood Alfredo ($13.95) and Mango Yogurt Tea ($4.45).I was skeptic at first, thinking Seafood Alfredo was a big mistake of it just being a couple of shrimp in some store Alfredo sauce. And while that may have been the case, I am still very satisfied with my meal. Not only did they give those couple of shrimps, but I also received mussels. And those mussels were juicy and a surprisingly good size! Similar to the Alfredo, the Mango Yogurt tasted exactly like what it sounded like. I like that they gave a couple of lychee jelly pieces inside!Overall, this positive meal experience was a green light for me to want to check out their restaurant next time. Definitely give this place a try for a filling meal!.The food here is good -- smells and looks better than it tastes haha but still good. My favorite was the beef stir fry. The beef noodle soup #1 was kind of bland so wouldn't get it again. The steak was good but kind of expensive for $30 as you don't get a lot. I would expect a lot more pasta from this dish as pasta is so cheap but they literally gave 2 bites. The steak was not bad and I had the house made black pepper sauce. The toast was good (wouldn't pay for it again). The soy milk here is definitely not freshly made and tastes like the costco bottled soy milk.Service was good -- quick and nice..福神牛肉館：主打食牛，牛扒拉麵真材實料好食又夠牛香味，拉麵湯底熬出牛所有精華出來，湯好好飲但我自己唔可以飲太多太補，牛肉燒餅、牛肉捲餅、紅油炒手我經常order !喜歡食牛的朋友應該喜歡.I have been coming to the us location since it opened in 2017 and I have never been disappointed l. I always come for the steak and eggs on top of noddles. The presentation and execution of sizzling table side steak is underrated at this location and I wish to come back for many more years to come..Everything was great, service was good, food was good expect my friend's salmon he told me it was dry. But the two steak we order was perfectly cooked and made well. Would recommend this place, and especially the steaks.First two are steaks the second on is the Salmon..I came on a Saturday afternoon with a friend right before the lunch rush. When you walk in, they immediately ask for your vax card and theres also hamdsanitizer and lysol spray by the door. We sat down and they gave us iced water in a big mug with a bendy straw (my favorite kind of straw). The water was lemon water, super refreshing.We ordered a black pepper steak over rice, the noodle soup with ox rib and an iced coffee. The steak came out first and omg it was amazing. The black pepper flavor was great and the egg was perfectly fried and runny. For the price, the amount of food was perfect. 10/10 dish (as im writing this, im waiting for 2 orders of this steak for takeout). The noodle soup was ok. It was a bit bland, but thats the way the soup is meant to be. My stomach wasn't feeling that great so this was a good choice. If you want more flavor, would recommend asking for extra chives. I loved that they had radish in the soup and the ox rib was cooked perfectly, super tender. For $9, the amount of noodles was more than enough. I could barely finish. The iced coffee was super worth. Best bang for your buck in the area at 2.50. It reminded me of Malaysian iced coffee. Next time I will definitely try the cast iron skillet steaks because they smelled absolutely divine. I was jealous of the other tables when I swear how good it looked..I ordered take out from Fu Shen Restaurant two nights ago and I'm still thinking about how good the meal was. I ordered beef dishes over rice to share and I was pleasantly surprised to see them come with egg, vegetables, and a side of soup! Now that's what I call a meal. I also ordered a side of spicy wontons and beef cakes. Everything from this place tasted so great and the beef was so flavorful and tender. I'm definitely going to order from this restaurant again."
"Depending on the food you order its pretty goodthere best plates are simple ones, bagel w/ butter etc...and  there corn muffins are amazing !and i recently tried a chicken Cesar salad, deliciousi must admit everything is a bit pricey, but there great attitudes almost make up for it.I just started a new job 2 weeks ago and this Deli is about 2 blocks away. I heard it used to be owned by another family and was sold recently. I read the other reviews and they are negative in my opinion. I think this place is a little Jewel on the Block. I have to say that they have the best grilled chicken I have ever tasted. Apparently they got the recipe from the owner's son before he sold them the deli. The son was a trained Cordon Bleu chef. The Caesar salad with the grilled chicken is incredible. Every day they have a different special and yes when you walk in it looks like any old Little Deli on the Block... if you going here pick any of the sandwiches are the heroes with grilled chicken and you will see exactly what I mean.great food and super friendly people working there... I work in the neighborhood and go there once at week at least. I call them for my food and then i pick it up but they can deliver if you want.they have lunch specials and their grilled chicken is OFF THE HOOK!!!!!.The food is very basic, but this is a good place to buy snacks. Prices are very inexpensive and the owners are friendly and helpful..Real nice type of place. Nice folks, family owned.1.The layout, weird. A deli(with a grill), a bodega, a diner, it's all      three,for the price of one.2.The food. I ordered a tuna melt sandwich,and a Snapple (about $6bucks) ouch. It was mediocre, they use super generic yellow American cheese, (yuck) most of which I scraped off the bread. The tuna needed more mayo, kinda tasted like cat food*...! Sorry Cousins,I experience better (cheaper) quality food at a 711.*I never ate catfood, but I've been told that tuna taste just like it."
"My family and I always bought cake from Capy when we were living in Queens. Until recently, I saw people carry their cake boxes while I was in Fordham area. I never knew this tiny Capy store was even existed and I passed the store so many times. Being Capy's fan in the past, I went there to get the chocolate tres leches cake for the kids and one strawberry for adults. They were delicious, moist and fresh. The price is also very reasonable.   I got these 2 yummy cakes for under $100The staffs are also very nice and helpful. This is what I love about Capy. All the staffs in every locations that I visited ( Jackson Heights and Corona) are very nice as well.Really small cute cake shop that specializes in tres leeches cakes. That is a sponge cake soaked in three kinds of milk making it very soft and moist. If that is something that you like, your cake tasting like the ice cream already melted into it, then this is the cake for you. So many to choose from as well. Their were some samples they had already available to try. Coconut and Chococaramel. My friend and I loved the coconut, and me not being a fan of eating anything coconut, I went with the choco one. Although it was good, I didn't really care for the wet texture of the cake. What I did care for was the pecan cookies that they had available for sale, not to mention if you make any purchase in the store you get a free coffee, water, etc. Along with other desserts and treats they have, you can buy their cakes by slice, I choose their cookies and cream to take home to the hubs and he enjoyed it. I also picked up some of their truffles. (Dulce de leche, Salted Carmel, and Banana Foster). The staff is super friendly and cool, I see more visits to come..If you want a cake Capy is perfect and delicious .I always buy cakes from this Place..We ordered the three leches cake for a birthday party and the cake was delicious, made fresh, wasn't soggy at all ( unlike other places I've tried). Everyone at the party was happy with the taste, and the fruit on top of the cake was the perfect touch. The cake was sweet, so I hope you have a good sweet tooth. We also ordered the cheesecake and that too was great. The cheesecake was nice and thick and exceeded my expectations. I will be returning!.Stopped here on my walk home bc the cakes on display looked amazing. I  got a small piece of the cookies and cream cheesecake for $4.75. It is a tad pricey but boy, it's worth every penny! It's delicious. Nice and dense with amazing flavor. Can't wait to go back and try the tres leches."
"Great domincan cakes!! Thinks its like 20 bucks for a freshly baked Dominican cake. Pineapple or guava, its always moist, fresh and deliously tasty! They have lots of freshed baked goods, cookies, sugar donuts, guava treats, flan and best of all.....individual cake slices at 2.50 a pce! They have cheesecake, all flavors of dominican cake, and tres leches (really creamy and good!) Slices are also a nice size, i usually pick up a variety of slices for bringing ova to someones house, people always love it! Prices are super resonable, its not really more than 3 bucks for any of there treats, they sell there sugar donuts at .50. Service is great, ladies are always friendly and helpful.Old school Dominican cakes, that taste so bomb!!!!Great Service, Great Taste, Super Fresh ..Best Dominican bakery in East New York, I've been going for 3yrs now and I definitely recommended..apparently people are invisible. i been standing here for 15 minutes and it's like i didn't exist. great oatmeal but TERRIBLE SERVICE.Excellent service great products but the address is wrong its on the prior block..I live 3 minutes away from this store, the cake slid and cracked by the time I got home even when it was placed flat in the trunk of my car.. It was embarrassing having to bring this cake out. I came a little early but it wasn't ready. I then waited for my pick up time and still had to wait an extra 30 mins. Not only I had to wait longer than expected but it wasn't even what I ordered. Customer service was terrible, I was getting frustrated speaking on the phone about the cake and the workers began to laugh. They've made nice cakes for my family before, I do not know what happened this time!! Very disappointed...Authentic Dominican pastries. LOVE the Dominican cakes. I travel from the other side of Brooklyn to get authentic Dominican cake from here..This place is horrible! Bad customer service, the breakfast is disgusting and everything I ordered was stale and dry. I bought various slices of Dominican cake all were dry and stale do not waste your time or money coming to this bakery. Just take the drive to Angela's for fresh baked goods plus the prices are better!.After having a basic but yummy and cheap breakfast here, i ordered a 3 Leches cake for my March Babies Rock party. Fair price.. $23 for half pound. So affortable versus Angela's Bakery. Great customer service unlike Angela's! Hoping my guests like the cake. Three until i taste their cake. Well, I will post an update next Sunday..This is a great bakery.  I've been a customer for years. If you need a cake for an occasion at the last moment they have it!  They sell slices of bread,pudding flan, tres Leches, cheese cake and more.  Very fresh and delicious.  Prices are great.  Employees are friendly and they have a low turn over.  They also make great breakfast and the prices are good! My advice  to them is never change never stop being wonderful!"
"This is a cute French bakery shop that in addition to their macarons and other delicious desserts has a great selection of sandwiches and light savory food. I absolutely love the Gainsbourg sandwiche, it has cooked ham and comte cheese on crusty French bread and butter. I am a weird person that hates mayonnaise so finding a place that adds butter automatically instead of mayonnaise just makes my life so much easier. While I really like the food here the service is very inconsistent. There are times when they are straight up rude or just very dismissive and having those types of interactions makes it difficult for me to want to return here regularly. If they improved their customer service this could be a 5 star place..Great sandwiches and quick. I was looking for a place to frequent near my home but they don't allow laptops/have strict rules about time etc inside. Might return if I ever want a sandwich but otherwise don't plan to be back..The perfect stop and the BEST place for croissants in Harlem! I love it here - French pastries are always so fresh, everyone who works here is really welcoming and they will warm your croissant- I only love warm pastries  what can I say. Try the almond or chocolate croissant and a latte, you won't regret it..Cute little spot with outdoor seating that is open on the earlier side in Harlem. Had the iced coffee. It was not bad, but I was disappointed by the lack of environmental consciousness. They give you your drink in a plastic or paper cup with a plastic lid. No reusable cups available.Maybe they will in the future!.So good! This place a hidden gem in Harlem! Amazing price and amazing quality. I am a new regular. I hope they can survive that neighborhood and this pandemic!.Le Petit Parisien is a very cute cafeteria, they have lot of variety food. They have very cute looking macaroons and gift boxes are available. I would recommend to go check it out! Staff is very friendly!!!.I came here to get some pastries on a Sunday. They had a great promotion at the time. The shop itself is very cute and the staff friendly. I got a chocolate croissant and a Nutella latte. The croissant was great but didn't love the latte. I should have gone with my regular drink of cappuccino. They also have sandwiches on the menu..I had a friend in town-we were looking for a place to sit, ease into the day and for me to get some work done. We both ordered matcha drinks (not the best quality, the powder wasn't blended in well) and sat outside where chairs and tables are set up. While sitting, and waiting for our order-Moes, an outdoor food vendor and neighborhood staple opened (it's located on the same block and right next to  Le Petit) so we ordered from him too.The manager/owner of Le Petit told us we had to leave because there was no outside food allowed. I understood to an extent...Mind you, we ordered from his establishment as well (and they initially got the order wrong). However, the owner/manager waited until we both sat down and got settled after ordering from Moes to tell us (I saw him inside the entire time watching while we ordered from him and then when we sat down and then ordered from Moes) His actions were in poor taste and  also reflect the lack of awareness some new businesses have about the culture of Harlem. I guess we should've only ordered from Moes and not support both establishments. Duly noted.The old coffee shop that use to be in Le Petit's place was great. It featured the art work of local artists, and was definitely a more inviting place.Woke up earlier to a rainy day forecast and it somehow transported me to rainy and cold days during month-long vacations in Paris and what comforted me would be a cup of hot chocolate and freshly baked pastries. So I looked up the nearest French bakery that can do delivery. Of course I was also lured in by the promising reviews of this place.Ordered croissants, pain au chocolat and the true test of it all as always, a baguette. Once Uber Eats got here, I was so excited. The croissants were as good as the ones I had in France and the pain au chocolat was delicious! The baguette for some reasons, did not really meet my expectations. I'm not sure if I got unlucky or if Uber Eats somehow didn't manage to pack it well. It was really cold and quite tough to eat. Really hoping it was the latter, especially because I've heard great things about it, using French flour, etc.Still loved most of the experience. Hope to be able to visit soon to check out everything else that they have to offer..Dropped by here for a quick and easy breakfast sandwich. Well, the sandwich was delicious, but I cannot say that I was absolutely blown away by it. Then again, are folks really blown away by breakfast sandwiches? The manager (or maybe he was the owner) was pretty nice and seemed to have a very friendly relationship with the restaurant's regulars. For the area, I think the price tag is a bit steep, but the quality of food is a bit better than the local bodegas. Also, Le Petit Parisien probably is one of the few dine-in places where one can grab breakfast items around 8/9am.Perhaps, I will drop by again to try out some of the other breakfast and non-breakfast items on the menu."
"I am here almost every day. It is the best spot. Everything looks clean and fresh and the menu gives you a lot of options. I get the arroz con pollo or a large Sabba's salad with steak. Generous portions make for a great value meal. The staff works hard to get orders out fast..Very nice service, place was empty when i visited, woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The chicken was great, the sides were okay. I would definitely order the chicken again if I went, but probably just with the pita bread. The sides while plentiful and flavored, just weren't necessary for me. The chicken is the star..We love this place!!! We order from them 2 - 3 times a week because they have so many options and type of food me and my boyfriend like. You can choose from omelette to salad or burgers. We will continue order from here..I just found out about this place. I ordered a week ago and the food was so good, the resturant even called to give me options because the ran out of a side item. Delivery was quick too. So today I ordered again two meals (just for me LOL) both delicous. Definitely going to be a regular customer..Delicious, filling salad with perfect portions of protein. Life saving at work. So thankful that they deliver. You have to try it. We love ordering it up at the hospital..I had an outstanding experience at Sabba's Chicken Harlem. This place is pretty solid. Every single thing we ordered was amazing and the menu itself was to die for. The team are super attentive and kind and they're very good at giving recommendations. Thank you Sabba's Chicken Harlem. I will be back..Delivery Person was not wearing a mask and didn't follow instructions on the order to leave it in the lobby. When I called to ask for them to make it right they only offered to send me new food. Not sure how that helps the situation at all..."
"We are in Staten Island, NY and we are so looking forward to eating and having a great time in the big Apple. It's a very small place and we  were craving Puerto Rican food. So we got the following: Puerto Rican rice - good Pasteles - good Pepper steak - very goodPernil - good Potatoe salad- bland but ok Pollo guisado - very good Alcapurrias - not good at all. Hard not edible. Took a bit and left the rest. Potatoe ball or relleno de papa- not good. The portions are worth the money. Very generous and the staff was very kind. Overall it was good. I'm Puerto Rican and a good cook at that so for me to say the food is good or very good is a compliment..Zero flavor. Bland not authentic Dominican food. Almost. Add flavor. Add some pride and joy to your food..Not real Dominican food and they close at 7:45pm how can you even order dinner definitely would not recommend.Terrible restaurant.  Over charge for a 3 meat plate without inform client the cost.  Cost just add up for each piece of meat.  This little box is almost $19.  Can't return again.We ordered from here last night. Everything was delicious and fresh. Delivery was quick and it's inexpensive. If you're looking for solid Puerto Rican food, this is a great place. Only one thing I didn't like was the alcupurrias. Great to have a new spot to order from instead of the usual..This restaurant is not far from highway 404.   It's a nice local Spanish restaurant with a few tables.   The staffs are friendly, they don't rush you to order.   The portion is very generous.   I ordered chicken with black beans and rice.   The chicken was well seasoned.  Black beans and rice was delicious.  Finding parking here is a problem since they don't have a parking lot..Ordered food this past weekend, absolutely terrible!!! I was charged 130 for small amounts of food.  I Understand restaurants are trying to make up for money lost during COVID.  But this is insane.  They serve way less food and charge more. To top it off food Was cold and wrong. Never going back there!!.In the search for solid Pernil and arroz con gandules took me to El Pollo today as it was recommended to me by the folks I work with.Parking is a disaster, very difficult to find a spot, there is parking within a 5 minute walk.Menu is listed when you walk in and the food is laid out in a large steam table for you to view.Portions are no joke, plates run between $9-$11.The pernil is excellent, seasoned perfectly. The arroz con gandules is good, unfortunately no olives and it could use more seasoning, solid nonetheless.I make this dish very well.....hey I know I'm Italian but I grew up in Coney Island and have a million Puerto Rican friends so I consider myself 3 percent Puerto Rican. Unfortunately my wife and kids don't like this dish and it's borderline ridiculous to cooks this unless you are making it for an army.El Pollo is clean and has approximately 10 tables of 4. The restaurant is very popular with contractors, city employees and laborers from the area.I highly recommend El Pollo and I cannot wait to go back and try something else as all of the food looks outstanding!.I don't know who is running this place but the quality of customer service has plummeted DRASTICALLY in recent years. Today is the second time I placed an order via Grubhub for Goat Stew (which is listed as a special today specifically on their Grubhub menu) and was not contacted by the restaurant to let me know it is unavailable and offer a substitution. First time this happened, a few months ago, I was waiting over 2 hours with no communication until I called myself and the lady on the phone just said ""We don't have it today"" OK?? Sooooooo you're just gonna leave me waiting for food that isn't being delivered? No phone call? Today played out the same way except I called a half hour into waiting to double check and of course was met with the same issue. ""Not today. We will have it tomorrow maybe"" what?? I will never again order from this place and I have eaten here for years. Common sense ain't so common, obviously. Get better staff..Authentic Spanish food in the middle of nowhere...wow I just found a gem! This place is delicious and affordable! The portions are huge and I would usually split it up to two with empanadas. Home made lemonade pairs well with it, yes it's homemade I saw them squeezing lemon juice out of the lemon ! I got the pernil and it is marinated very well. The skin is fatty delicious. Pair it with rice and pigeon peas and it's pretty good. I normally ask for some sauce on the rice. Empanadas are crunchy. I will be back to try the ribs and curry next time :).First time ordering from this business and I enjoyed the food. If you're looking for comfort Dominican food, look no further. I ordered their beef stew, pork chops, Mofongo with pork chunks and it came with a delicious gravy you can put on top, their morir sonando was also delicious."
"I can change my review now that they under bee ownership and I have to say yes!!! Please go and try them there bagels are delicious the gentleman and the counter is very nice the bagels are water boiled nice and fluffy.Been going here for a while always order the same thing The prices are always in consistent another thing that it is extremely annoying when sometimes I just come in for a coffee he's always so pushy bacon I get a cheese bacon egg and cheese bacon egg and cheese HIS EXACT WORD if I wanted bacon egg and cubes would I order it !!!!!Thank god for lifetime.This is the second time I'm ordering from here and it's horrible. I gave them a second chance and ordered a bagel with cream cheese and they don't put any cream cheese on the bagel. I opened it up and asked them and they said they would have to charge me for extra cream cheese. It's insane that they're able to get away with that. I would not recommend this place..Ug, so decided to try this place for the very 1st time and probably last time.My favorite thing to get at any bagel spot is an Everything bagel with cream cheese and lox.I ordered the a scooped out everything bagel with cream cheese and lox. When I got home it wasn't scooped out and there was barely ANY lox as shown in the pic. Cost me $7.61.The bagel tasted fine but had kind of a sweetness to it which I just didn't care for.The place seemed to have only 2 people working. My guess was the owner and a helper. On line there were 3 people including myself. They seemed to be behind like they could of used more help preparing the food. I mean only 3 people waiting for food and they are in the weeds???The number of items listed on the menu seemed way too much for what they could handle. I rather a spot focus on fewer items and do that really well then have a monster selection with everything coming out mediocre.Think this is just a case of bad management, organization, and common sense. I rather pay more for a really good bagel with cream cheese and lox then to get what I received. Just killed my morning :(.Overall, a negative experience. I walked in and the place was very dirty, napkins and garbage all over the floor. Management was totally scatterbrain, i ordered a grilled cheese because i was in a rush and needed something to hold me off. The chefs seemed to know what they were doing, but management wasn't able to keep up and was mixing up orders. Another woman next to me complained of a warm coffee that needed to be heated up. The grilled cheese was super oily, super salty and overall too cheesy. I ended up throwing it away.Owners also charged me a higher price than listed, i didn't appreciate that..I love their bagels- been coming here since I was a kid and never disappointed. They're fluffy and humongous- no hole, how it should be in my opinion..Ownership changed and prices have not onlygone up (with no major change to quality of food or service) but depending on the day and the person working the register, prices fluctuate (about $1.50) when the exact same order is placed. When this was brought to the attention of the owner she seemed unbothered about losing the business rather than rectifying the price. They also haven't fixed their ATM, which isn't helpful to their customers when there is a minimum for card use. I like the chef, which is the only reason I gave it more than 1 star. I was a loyal customer for over a decade. But they can keep their $6.30... or $7.50... or $7.75...breakfast, I will not be returning..A year later and I came back to Peters and will say it's very different.  Bagels and coffee are now fresh, and it has become my go to spot for a quick breakfast pickup. Not sure if ownership changed but it's way better than it was last year. Glad I gave it a second try..Peters bagels is the worst deli in the area for multiple reasons. First, the bagels are terrible, not fresh, stale and taste like plastic. I'm not even a bagel snob but the ones here are deplorable. Second, they don't even use butter. Instead, you get a plastic tasting spread. Third, there is multiple expired breads, wraps and other items in the fridge. I went today 10/13 and saw the expiration date on the spinach wraps for 06/2019 (over 4 months expired!). The icing on the cake is when the owners try to push you to buy additional items. Trying to just grab a coffee? Expect them to ask you to buy a bagel, sandwich or a muffin. Want just an egg and cheese on a roll? They'll ask you multiple times to add meat. It's sad this place is even in business. But that's what happens when it's the only deli on this side of bell blvd..Best bagels around. Super friendly service. Lots of different drink options. Also black & white cookie is great!!! Giving it a 4 because they lacked on the breakfast sandwich. Needs more oomph like more eggs and filling..This place is my go-to for coffee, bagels, and sandwiches. They have never failed to deliver food with excellent quality at great prices..Always had a great experience at Peters Hot Bagels. Price is right and food is perfect. Customer service is always top notch. Can not find any complaints in any ways. Only complaint is the rude customer base in the mornings that are making it difficult for the workers. Thank you guys."
"Love the food here. They have much more than just chicken! I live in the area and this is my go-to spot when I want to grab a quick meal. Great quality! And the people who work here are great!.I love fried chicken and when I'm on more healthy kick I opt for the rotisserie chicken, so Louie's is the perfect spot to go. When I saw chicken parm sandwich on the menu, I was sold! I love their friend chicken and Mac n cheese too. They even have bread pudding on the menu for us dessert lovers. Also try their homemade meatballs. Love the assortment of sides you can get here!.Looking for a new lunch spot in the area that wasn't too expensive. This restaurant seemed to fit the bill with afford menu options and available seating both inside and outdoors (though limited).Decided on the 1/4 chicken combo with sautéed mushrooms and grilled veggies ($12ish). Rotisserie chicken is golden crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle. Needed no extra sauces and the flavor of the chicken is accentuated. Mushrooms are on the hearty side that could have used some more salt. Grilled veggies are your standard fare.People behind the counter are quick and friendly. Like they have healthy options, though would want to try something more substantial next time for the true experience..Usually it's kind of hard finding a different place to get lunch from when you've worked in the same area for a long time.  I try different spots in the midtown area whenever I get tired of the same old food-chains.  Not sure how long Louie's has been in business but I tried them for the 1st time today. The Louie spicy crispy sandwich is really good, could be spicier if you're into that stuff, but I found it to have the right amount of spice.  I also ordered the fries and a small mac & cheese.  The Mac n cheese seems baked and is not overbearing with cheese at all. The fries could've been crispier but they did taste fresh. It's a quaint spot but it has a lot of variety.  The potato latke was looking at me, but I'll get that next time for sure. Definitely going back..Visiting NYC and came upon this fabulous place.  The chicken was delicious...tender and flavorful.  Many choices of sides from decadent Mac & cheese to health Brussels sprouts.   All the food was fresh and well prepared. We went here twice and even later in the evening at 8:30 the food looked very fresh. The staff was fast and friendly.  And all this for a reasonable price.  This is definitely on our go-to list for our visits to New York.Excellent fried chicken for sure. Crispy outside juicy inside. Lunch menu great value. $11.99 for main and 2 sides. Had fried chicken with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes had good flavor but a bit loose. Mac and cheese good but could be more creamy.  For the value excellent meal. Fast delivery. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu..Wow, we were impressed.  We haven't bought a rotisserie chicken in a decade or more (I may a good chicken at home!) but were on the way home from a couple of hours of walking around MoMA & wanted a quick & easy dinner; this place is a couple of blocks away!So we picked up a whole rotisserie chicken (they sell organic ones, too, but we didn't spring for the extra bucks) - two meals for us.  Two small sides that we demolished - mushroom & barley and kasha varnishkes (like my grandma used to make!).  Plus, an Israeli salad that was not at all oily, and fresh chunks of cucumber, tomato, and onion, really really good.I'm now a fan & will be ordering here again!.Dry, not seasoned well and way OVERPRICED!Normally when you walk into a roasted chicken place your mouth can water from the scent in the air. At Louie's there was none of that.Don't bother spending your hard earned bucks on this chicken. The desserts looked good but I don't think they are made in house..Good but overpriced. Worth it if you are really hungry and have money to blow because 20$ for a quarter chicken and 1 small side is not it.Service was fast and friendly and worth 5 stars alone. The owner greeted us upon entry and asked if we needed help ordering. The lunch special was healthy and a great deal. We both got lemon grilled chicken. There were about 15 side choices which made it so difficult to choose. In the end I went with creamed spinach with mushrooms and Israeli salad and my boyfriend went with Brussel sprouts that were large and fresh (not withered). They had some sort ofMustard taste but it wasn't overly Coated which is nice.The Israeli salad was crisp and perfectly seasoned. The owner requested that we try the meatballs which were superb and rivaled any top Italian restaurant. They were moist and flavorful and the sauce was fresh and tasty. There are a few tables for outdoor dining if you choose to stay, and the owner is not opposed to you bringing some wine.Highly recommend."
"I almost don't want to leave a review to let the secret out about my new go-to for Guyanese/Chinese. The lamb dishes are a game-changer. The lamb is thinly sliced and tender. I got the spicy garlic lamb which I expected to be spicier but it was still flavorful, I'm definitely trying the jerk next time. We also ordered boneless cha chi kai chicken, jerk chicken rasta pasta, chicken lo mein, and veg fried rice. Everything was tasty and I'm happily eating leftovers as I write this..Definitely a hole in the wall spot I must've walked past a bunch of times but I'm glad I actually stopped in. It looks like a club/lounge which is why I never anticipated their food being as good as it is The portion they give of their shrimp Rasta pasta is huge! I appreciated that they packed a menu, a small bag with napkins, utensils and pepper sauce in my take out order. I liked my pasta very much. the shrimp was a little over cooked so a few of the shrimp did taste rubbery but despite that I do see myself returning..I have to say by far this is the best takeout food I have had in a very long time. The flavors were on point. The service was great. The location is amazing and beautiful. I can't wait for them to be fully open for dinning in. And man the owner is an amazing person, she took her time to answer all my questions, and made my visit a great experience. I will definitely be back for more. Thank you for a great dinner experience. I loved every little bit of it!!!"
"I am in love with this place! I always try to find new things to do but I usually get sick of things quickly... this is NOT the case with B MVMT! I look forward to going to classes (never thought I would LOVE working out)! I leave every class feeling better about myself and my body. I started off with the 2 week unlimited and now I have a monthly membership. The instructors and staff truly make you feel at home and special. B MVMT has changed my outlook on working out and how I view my body..I went to check the studio out and really enjoyed the ambiance and the vibes.The class was ridiculously good, it took me out of my comfort zone. The music was A1, and the instructor Shari was energetic and so incredible that I definitely left feeling myself even more after that class..Great studio; exceeded my expectations. The owners & staff were super personable. Studio is rather large; changing room was a legit lounge (mmm Kay). There's a gorgeous backyard with WiFi. And most important, the BUTI class was BOMB AF. I signed up for the new student special (2 weeks unlimited for $50) so I'll be back very soon!.Bizzie Gold, the entrepreneurial founder of Buti Yoga, opened her first NYC based studio, smack dab in trendy, LES. Buti Yoga combines pylometrics, vinyasa flow, tribal dance and chakra work with the signature spiral technique. Music is loud and pulsing, the room is sometimes hot. The results are transformative. BMVMNT is a fantastic studio. There is a large communal area with retail options, a bar to purchase a Golden Ration shake, Bizzie's own health food line. In the studio, neon, empowering wall messages and an ""intention board"" are present. It's a nurturing room yet one that allows the creative and shakti energy to flow. Bizzie's own line of mats are available for use. Outside, there is a lovely sitting area for after Buti rest, meditation or socializing. Downstairs are lockers, infrared sauna and lounge. The place is immaculate.  Sara, the manager is warm and welcoming. She is a soulful presence, representing the brand as the consummate professional.   I took 4 classes. Peter offers a kick ass advanced format. Dawn is a beautiful teacher with a flowing and challenging class. I loved Shari's lovely energy and her eagerness to insure her students have a wonderful experience. Justin's class was flawless. His flow, his moves and his free flow choreography was amazing. He transformed me in one class. I left feeling empowered and energized. This is a NOT TO MISS experience. Buti Bliss!!.I really enjoyed my class I took today. I took hot budi and it definitely delivered. It's like this dancey, yoga, ab centric, type workout and it was so much fun. With the infrared light I was sweating like crazy! Really supportive environment and you can do 2 week unlimited for $50 as a new client. I'm doing the free infrared sauna tomorrow. 55 minutes as apart of the promotion!!.So I was looking for something that brought me joy and energy while also working out. Something that could balance my mind, spirit and body. If you are looking for something similar I'm here to let you know that this is the RIGHT PLACE! At any level you are in your practice just come and join. That is no judgement and the instructors are amazing. You will feel welcomed in a ambience of great energy and smiles. It's a place of freedom, struggle and self discovery... I'm loving it. I'm definitely hooked! Give it a try peeps! You won't regret it!"
"This place doesn't look like much but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality pizza they're serving up. I casually came by for a snack the first time and ordered the mushroom slice. This time, I had the chicken and bacon slice. I must say they have the perfect thin crust to crunch ratio. You can tell they use corn meal in the crust and it delivers. The crust is not overly doughy.  It's crunchy without tasting like a cracker. And the ingredients were delicious. This is what a New York slice should taste like. My only complaint is that the service is a bit lacking. The pizza is on point but the cashiers/pizza servers are not the most skilled. They're a bit slow and seem to fumble with the easiest tasks like cutting a slice or bagging it to go..The pizza made here is terrible. It's not NY pizza, it's not thin crust, it's just bad. A sparse amount of cheese, no dough, what are you paying for? It's 3.25 and it's on par with the 99 cent slices a few blocks away. It was just disappointing. Don't go..Biggest jerk ever works here. Minus all the stars for being rude and having the worst customer service of all time. I refuse to ever order pizza again from this place. I rather go eat papa john's. He leaves his customers standing around. Tells them they shouldn't bother the chef. Then huffs and puffs about how customers are always expecting to much. No one should go here again and then he won't have any customers to expect anything from him again..Nice spot, very clean and great taste! Really good cheese pizza! The supreme was delicious as well! Compliments to the Asian girl, very nice and friendly!.We finally got through to order on the phone for 4 regular pies. He said 25 mins. My husband goes there in 20 mins. He sees 3 pies sitting and ready. The worker pulls out a pie from the oven and gives that to another customer. My husband was pissed !! Don't understand why he gave that to another person. So my husband had to stand there and wait for them to put in a new pie to cook. That was another 15 mins of wait. My husband asks for 30 plates. Worker said I will have to charge for the plates. Why?!?! We are obviously having a party and we ordered 4 pies. We didn't order one pie asking for 30 plates!! That made no sense. This place will not get any of our business again and will tell our friends the same..This place looks nondescript, but they have excellent pizza, a stylish take on New York thin crust. Like with any pizzeria, it's better if you get a pie. But the slices are solid too, especially the fresh mozzarella..I really enjoyed the pizza here! I came here twice and fell in love with the pizza that has chicken and broccoli on it! It was so fresh and tasty! This place does not get 5 stars because one day I tried their cheese pizza and it was blah! It barely had any cheese on it!.The delivery guy dropped the pizza on my lobby floor took it back and said will deliver again and never did! They never picked up the phone when we called.  Worst customer service I have ever seen!.***AVOID***This place only has 1 guy working here.  He takes the orders, makes the food, collects the money and the customers are just standing around waiting to either order, pay or waiting for their food.  Who knows this could be the same guy delivering the pizza because they are too cheap to hire another person.  We waited an hour after ordering and the food sucked and didn't even get an apology for the wait.  We tried to order spaghetti and meatballs, they didn't have any meatballs.  We also tried to order Hawaiian pizza and a slice with just ham, no more ham.  The pasta was disgusting and the wings were burnt.  I also ordered 6 slices and he put them on top of each other in a small box instead of a big one.  $40 for 6 cold slices, 2 orders of horrible wings and 1 dried ass pasta and they couldn't spare a large pizza box.  REALY?!? This place is a joke, do yourself a favor and don't come here..!!!!!Never going back!!!!These people do not know how to handle busy foot traffic, and for a business that heavily relies on selling slices, it's ridiculous. The male staff made rude comments towards me and rolled his eyes when I ordered a few slices and they were getting behind on pizzas. One woman tried ordering a salad and they refused to make her one since they were backed up. Literally only came here because its usually fast but I will FOR SURE be taking my business to Clinton Square Pizza from now on. The staff there is so sweet and the pizza is 10x better."
"I think I've had most of the menu at this point and it's all extremely good. The Shanghai pork belly noodles are incredible, as are all of the dumplings..Great location off the Prospect Park SW, ideal for a quick pre or post Nitehawk movie perhaps for the budget conscious. Realized after it's kind of pricey for what you get, 16 oz iced bubble tea and 5 pork dumplings was about $15 with tax. Dumplings were extremely tasty, crispy and doughy just how I like it. Was told it would take 10-15 min but only waited under 5. Worth checking out..Just a little update to mention that on a recent trip to this spot I learned that these dumplings are not vegan. There's gelatin in the wraps. Kind of a bummer because I asked before and was told that the dumplings were vegan. It happens though. I just wanted to update my review in case other vegans are curious about trying something here..I stopped in here to grab a quick bite and was blown away by the Veggie Dumplings. Five large, thick-skinned dumplings packed with al dente vegetables. They were absolutely delicious and topped  with a cilantro scallion sauce that was simply outstanding!The space is bright, cheerful, and welcoming with quick, friendly service. It seems to have pretty limited vegan options but I will be back to check them out..While strolling around, I started to get hungry. This place was ideal because 'snacks?' Sure! I ordered the pork belly Bao and beef potstickers. The potstickers were my favorite since the beef was bountiful and tasted fresh (which is funny because it is dry aged beef.) The soy sauce and hot sauce went great. I usually don't like bao but this was nice. I would order again. I will say this place is popular and only allows one person inside at a time so you may be waiting outside awkwardly with others while picking up/ordering..While waiting in line for a concert at Prospect Park, I decided to grab some takeout from this place. I put my order through on Yelp and walked over to pick it up. It was ready fairly quickly and I didn't have to wait long at all. I ordered the Dry Aged Beef Potstickers and the Incredible Har Gow dumplings. I was so excited but unfortunately was not impressed. I ended up sharing them with my friends who also did not like them. The dry aged beef Potstickers didn't even taste cooked. The meat was so mushy and soggy, and came with a weird smell. The the shrimp ones (har gow) had a strange smell also. Unfortunately, I wouldn't return..Eaten here a couple times and it's always delicious! I get the pan fried juicy pork dumplings, dry aged beef pot stickers, incredible har gow shrimp dumplings and honey lemon sour plum iced drink. My partner didn't want a sour plum drink, I gave him a sip and then drank half of mine, so he had to buy me another one to make up for it. The pork is juicy, beef is tasty, shrimp dumplings are my favorite and the sour plum drink is awesome! Would love to come back and try some of the main dishes on the menu. Everyone around me was also really enjoying their food, in their tiny outdoor seating area..The five stars is for the dumpling dough alone. There's something more glutinous, chewy, sourdoughy, almost translucent but thick at the same time... and the way it's fried makes it something I thought about hours after I ate it. We got the dry aged beef potstickers, the pork dumplings, the veggie dumplings, and 2 pork belly bao buns. Actually the five stars is also for the bao buns which were, as promised, really good. Really hard to eat daintily, but really good. The bun is so thicc it doesn't really fold so you kind of have to go in mini pizza instead of taco style. But the bite through the pork belly and the pillowy bun with all the juicy and crispy seasoning was one of the best bites I've had in a while. The pork dumplings were juicy and tangy sweet - piping hot. They and the dry aged beef potstickers were smaller than expected, maybe half or 3/4 the size of steamed dumplings you get at the usual Chinese spots and there were only five of them as opposed to the usual 6. It's usually 6 right? Easier number to share if you're sharing dumplings with someone. Actually hold on a sec... DEAR EAST WIND ... CHARGE MORE AND MAKE IT 6!!! Speaking of which these dumplings are more expensive than you are used to but the lady is there rolling out the dough and making them in front of the shop and the ingredients are definitely a pleasant change from what you are used to. Reading some of the other reviews here sounds like some people out there don't know how to handle a little stank on their meat which brings me to how subtly delicious the dry aged beef potstickers are. I wouldn't be surprised if I got one of them on a huge plate at one of those Michelin star tasting menu places. Anyway, while the meat dumplings are smaller than you expect, the veggie dumplings are larger. They are filled with fresh julienned vegetables and topped with a pleasant green sauce and crunchy sesame seed. I almost stopped by to grab another order of them the next day as a snack. Looking forward to spending a little extra money trying these special dumplings again, also looking forward to trying some of the bowls on the menu. Oh but before I sign off, I will say, if I weren't an ignorant white Chinese-food-lover I would deduct half a star in demanding dumpling sauce ... isn't there supposed to be special dumpling sauce? With these dumps you just get soy sauce and sriracha and the soy sauce is too salty and overpowers the dumps. Why no dumpling sauce with the soy and the vinegar and the oil and the garlic and whatever the heck else is in there? DEAR EAST WIND... I WILL PAY A DOLLAR EXTRA FOR A LITTLE TUB OF DUMPLING SAUCE TO GO WITH THESE FINE DUMPLINGS! Ok, That's all, I'll be back soon sauce or no sauce..I have recently discovered this spot and I have to highly recommend it.  The dumplings and ribs are absolutely delicious and the delivery is fast and efficient.  I especially enjoy the vegetable dumplings ....like nothing I have ever had before..Perfect. This is as close as it gets to the baos and dumplings I used to eat in Hong Kong. The pork belly bao is perfectly seasoned, tender, and juicy. The dim sums are super flavorful, fresh and juicy. Really! If you bite into one, it's an explosion of flavors. Try not to get juice everywhere else. Try not to eat it on the walk home from picking it up. Super stuff!.I never write reviews but this place is actually atrocious. The bubble tea is so watered down and overpriced. The boba was rotten, hard, and sour. They charged 5 dollars for this horrendous watered-down, see-through bubble tea and two whole dollars for bottled water. I am extremely furious that they made 7 dollars off me yesterday."
"Not sure why this place is named Dunkin Baskin- it is a Dunkin donuts with ice cream- almost all dunkins have ice cream these days.My husband came here yesterday- got me a whole wheat bagel with low fat cream cheese (low at cream cheese comes in a set amount package, which I've gotten tons of times before).My bagel had literally no cream cheese. Caramel macchiato is also a fail here..Slow as fuck for something that shouldn't take so long, they have like 5 things on the menu and apparently nothing else. Iced coffee is stale as hell with like 95% milk and syrup. The avocado toast tastes like burnt plastic on gummy bread. I hope they check expiration dates on their stuff. It looks all fancy inside but nah, man. They don't even call you for your stuff either, I had to guess which thing was mine because they say nothing and just put it on the counter unless you're right up front. The guy at the register put his fuggin' VISIBLY DIRTY-ASS GLOVELESS HAND in my face waiting for my money. I should've just dapped him up and left. Do me a favor and don't go to this Dunkin.  You're better off at Starbucks where they actually put effort into your order instead of heavily scratching their gooch while pouring an ""on-tap"" coffee..Genuinely the worst service I've ever experienced. They have not once gotten my order correct and in an orderly fashion. There is always something wrong. They constantly forget to make your drink or give you something and you have to ask again for them to make it. Their change machine is almost always broken. After trying to just deal with it for a while, I am never coming back to that location..Super rude worker. I came in with my bicycle. Was waiting for about 5 mins behind another customer. She saw me when I came in and when it was my turn she very rudely say ""you can't come in with a bike, you need to go"" and points to the door. First there are no signs that says you cannot bring in a bike, and even if there were a hidden sign, this is not how you treat a customer. I don't know how dunkin provides customer service quality control over franchises but I'm no longer going to this store anymore..Just walked out of this Dunkin after being treated very rudely by an employee!My friend politely inquired if she had to pay prior to ordering a few ice cream flavors. His response was ' I don't have time for this' :(He's obviously clueless about customer service.I also asked him if he had any gluten free ice cream and he responded with 'only vegan' ..Shit customer service. The workers do not know what they're doing 95% of the time. Don't know if they even got trained properly! They will forget your order and serve people after you until you remind them of your order. Don't know how they get the audacity to give you an attitude when something is in their fault. Management seriously needs to take charge!.I walked past this small Dunkin' on a walk in the neighborhood a few weeks ago. The line was long, but it moved fast. If you're a fan of Dunkin' (either for their donuts or coffee), this one's not bad..This Dunkin' used to be one of the better ones. Not anymore!! My daughter went in after school earlier this week. She waited almost 20 minutes to get to the register, she placed her order and waited another 15 minutes!! SMH. For an avocado toast and a caramel macchiato!? Seriously!? As the lady threw her avocado toast at her for asking for a refund so she could go elsewhere, another customer knocks over her drink. The lady made her pay for another drink even though she SAW ANOTHER CUSTOMER knock it off the counter, not my kid. Needless to say she paid for ANOTHER drink and had to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes to get it. She's lucky I wasn't there. Lol. Bottom line, stay away!! You used to be able to get a quick, decent cup of coffee from Dunkin', now you get expensive, crappy coffee with a side of an hour in this store and nasty employees who are in need of some serious retraining or a new job. For that, I'll take my business elsewhere. Not sure what happened to this store, they really need their old management back here because this place fell to s**t since they renovated..I promise you this is the worst Dunkin' Donuts I've ever been to. They suck at making coffee and the breakfast for get about it. Avoid at all cost, they're simply lazy!.We had just had a wonderful dinner.. and wanted som dessert so the best place we cud go was dunkins donuts.. but this guy his name is Shovik.. was so unpleasant.. and had an attitude.. hey if u do not want to wnork.go home.. u don't have to behave in a way that u spoil some one nice evening and we were just trying pick an ice cream... and he said he did not have time for us and there was no one but 1 person who just entered the store.. it was not that he had a line of customers waiting at 9pm...very unprofessional..rude..mean..and zero customer service.. has to go a hell Lotta traning..he lost 4 big ice cream and coffee customers.. and we would never go there again... sad state of affairs..."
